In Calif. \"TAP PLASTIC\" is\na chain that carries most of what is needed for repair and sometimes\nreplacement of plastic bits.  Telephone in the Bay area is 415-962-8430.\nI'm not sure how amenable they are to shipping.  I have found that they\nhave several excellent products for cleaning, and removing crap from\nwindscreens and face shields.  Also they have one called \"lift-it\" which\nworks real well in removing sticky stuffs such as adhessives from plastic\nwihtout scratching same.\n\nLuck,\n\nJonathan Jefferies, jeff@mri.com",

If you're feeling\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\nthat you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\n\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\nnet, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.\n\nBy now you're probably asking \"So who's the KotL already?\". Well, as\nJohn Sloan notes below, that's about the only real \"secret\" left around\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\nKotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\nDead-Head.\n\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\n\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\ne-mail address. For example:\n\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\n\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\nrequirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\n\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\n\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]\n\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \nargue with each other and plan rides together.\n\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\n\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it's the file name for \nthe group's primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \nto as the DoD.\n\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\n\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, Norway and Finland.\n\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\n\nAs often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \nDoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's \n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \n\"Joust.\"\n\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\n\nThough it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to \nget together.  Long may they flame.\n\n\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\t[centerbar]\n\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \nability and your cat.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\n\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\n\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\nwomen inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\nhalls of academe for generations. \n\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \n\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\nthe funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\nnumber. \n\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\nminded enough to accept us as members. \n\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \n\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \n\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\nincludes name, state, and email address. \n\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \n\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\n\n\tChuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\n \n\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \n              :-(  x    / /         \\ \\    x   )-:     \n             :-(  x    / / -\\-----/- \\ \\    x   )-:    \n            :-(  L     | \\/  \\   /  \\/ |     F   )-:   \n            :-(  I     | /    \\ /    \\ |     L   )-:   \n            :-(  V     \\/ __   /   __ \\/     A   )-:   \n            :-(  E     / /  \\     /  \\ \\     M   )-:   \n            :-(        | |   \\   /   | |     E   )-:   \n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \n            :-(  O     | \\___// \\\\___/ |     T   )-:   \n            :-(         \\     \\_/     /      O   )-:   \n            :-(  F       \\___     ___/           )-:   \n            :-(  L        \\ \\     / /        L   )-:   \n            :-(  A         \\ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \n             :-(  x        \\_______/        x   )-:    \n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      The DoD\n\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\n \nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples?

It's just your guilt complex working against\nyou. Read 'em and weep. \n\nWe tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible\nBarbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to\nReverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: \n\nTerrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! \n\nMuck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW\n     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer\n     11 but what the heck.  \n\nStompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.\n\nTerrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at\n     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!\n     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a\n     Woosh-a-stream.\n\nStompin: You mean Wee-Stream.\n\nTerrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???\n\nStompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see\n     what they say, eh? \n\nMuck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.\n\nHigh Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.\n\nArlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!\n\nTerrible: B.T.???\n\nArlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.\n\nMuck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.\n\nTerrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? \n\nMuck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.\n\nTerrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.\n\nMuck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.\n\nChunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!\n\nTerrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???\n\nChunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean \n     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! \n\nMuck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.\n\nOut of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with\nDill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and\nthe perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! \n\nHeritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?\n\nTerrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?\n\nHeritick: Nahhh.\n\nHooter: Hoot, Hoot.\n\nBuck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?\n\nHooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!\n\nMuck: What's a carbujector?\n\nHooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!\n\nMuck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!\n\nDill: Well, where do we race?\n\nSnob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't\n     ride! \n\nMuck: No! No! Quiet!\n\nTread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.\n     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!\n\nHigh: My 9 too!\n\nTerrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!\n\nStompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!\n\nBefore this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more\ncohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the\ninfamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! \n\nPolyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like\n     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting\n     it up on the ole ventral stand!  \n\nTerrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and\n     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! \n\nBooster: I hate Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.\n\nBooster: I love Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW WE KNOW.\n\nMuck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?\n\nSnob, Tread: Nawwwwww.\n\nMuck: What about a Tridump?\n\nTerrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?\n\nMuck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?\n\nHeritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?\n\nMuck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.\n\nTwo more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.\nPill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.\n\nPhalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.\n\nAnd Now even more west coasters pour in.\nRoad O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!\n\nMaulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!\n\nSuddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:\nKite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.\n\nRobo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.\n\nMore riders from the west coast come into the discussion:\nAviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.\n\nGuess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.\n\nWith a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It\nwas none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. \nClean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. \n\nMuck: Why??\n\nClean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.\n\nMuck: But I only have a 4-banger.\n\nClean: No GOOD!\n\nChunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!\n\nClean: Inferior!\n\nStompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys\nburst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a\nthrill... \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? \n\nHeritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,\n     WILHEM! \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? \n\nAnd so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the\nthunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all\nboomed out.\nG.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding\n     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. \n\nAll: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.\n\nDoes this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding\nmini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the\nnext gut wretching episode of \"The Yearning and Riderless\" with its\never increasing cast of characters.

Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat\nBoy.] \n\nChuck [Sings to the tune of \"The Lumberjack Song\"]:\n\nI'm a Denizen and I'm okay,\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:\nHe's a Denizen and he's okay,\nHe flames all night and he rides all day.\n\nI ride my bike;\nI eat my lunch;\nI go to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays I ride Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus]:\nHe rides his bike;\nHe eats his lunch;\nHe goes to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays he rides Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\n'Cause He's a Denizen...\n\nI ride real fast,\nMy name is Chuck,\nIt somehow seems to fit.\nI over-rate the worst bad f*ck,\nBut like a real good sh*t.\n\nOh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\nOh, He's a Denizen...\n\nI wear high heels\nAnd bright pink shorts,\n full leathers and a bra.\nI wish I rode a Harley,\n just like my dear mama.\n\n[Chorus refrain]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    Why you have to be killed.\n\nWell, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed\nto read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started\nas a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\n\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\nstand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\nto the occasion and replied:\n\n\"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.\"\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\nknown) include:\n\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\t\tDoers of Donuts\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\t\tDebasers of Daughters\nDickweeds of Denver\t\t\tDriveway of Death\nDebauchers of Donuts\t\t\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\n\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\nlimited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\n\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\n\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\n\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\nto use the archive.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nVia ftp:\n\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\n\nVia e-mail:\n\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\n\ndir [dod]\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\n\nand you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\n\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\nthe next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of\n50K each; not a good idea.\n-- \nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\n\n**********************************************************\n\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Patches? What patches?\n\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That's sick!\", or\nperhaps \"That's sick! I want!\"\n\nWell, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\nthere's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\nnews is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\nsomeone says \"I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\nthis is anarchy in action.\n\nHere's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\npopular demand].\n\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\nyou'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\n\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\n\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\nthe other day.\n\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\n\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\nDenizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is\nnow $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude\nto all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently\nbeing prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to \nsee the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,\nI will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank \nyou for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the\nmuseum, and the fulfillment of its goals.\n\n                                Sincerely,\n\n\n                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395\n                                Director\n\nP.S.

Over $5500  [Arnie]\n \n                        Organized (?) Rides:\n\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\n\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\n2-strokes.  And though it's not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\nto gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.\nEuropean Denizens have staged some gathers too.

Additionally,\nit had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at\nfirst I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),\nbut I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,\nthe gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like \n900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the\nrear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)\n\nSo, what did I see?\n\n(PS, for any of you Boulder DoDers, I saw it parked at the Engineering\ncenter today.

It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had\nalcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.\n\nThe judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose\nand said in his sternest voice: \"Well son, those are some pretty\nfast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.

Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity\nto highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended\nthat manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function\nprovided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the\ngas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the \nrider doesn't.

Advantages of leather\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\n    than upper Aerostich.\n\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out \nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\n\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\n\nSteve\n--\n-- \n Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu\n (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu\n 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250\n \"Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry...\"",

No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance.

This is\n  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had\n  any problems with it.\n\n  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than \n  a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better \n  suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non\n  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.\n  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear\n  changes.\n  \n  The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike\n  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a\n  custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect\n  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced \n  by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up\n  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better\n  ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.\n\n  So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg,\n  which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.",

Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse\n D'Elegance and more.\n \n \tThis is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the \n event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,\n \"The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more\n complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our\n two most favrite highways- Highway 70, which goes through the Feather River\n Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's\n Highway 49.\"\n \n \tDay passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a \n pre-registered guest of a BMW rider.\n \t\n \tThe Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89,\n two miles South of downtown Quincy.\n \n \tFor pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug\n Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA\n 94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195\n\n ADDITIONAL NOTES:: \n   This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.\n   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one\n   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so\n   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.\n\n   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.\n   For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa, \n   Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.\n   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.\n   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. \n   Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early\n   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays\n   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday\n   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the\n   awards ceremony.  \n\n   For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on \n   registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course\n   be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider < betting 70 +\n   needed to win> and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15>.\n   and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.",

It was for car use but we thought we'd try it on my\nRD350B.  It worked OK apart from one slight problem: we had to keep the revs \nabove 7000.  Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement.\n\nIt made for interesting cups of coffee, anyhow.  We would plot routes that\ncontained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to\nget the water to boiling point.

Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code\nonly tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a\nwide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any\nadvice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.\n\nIf you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,\nstudy it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really\nhappens.  Read \"Fight Your Ticket\" too, but don't miss the little\nsection at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're\nbasically screwed.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here in\nCalifornia.

Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

At a tuned engine rpm, the\nstacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air\nrushing in.\nAir momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of\nthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside\nlong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.\nShock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from\nescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion\nchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)\nto the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they\ndesign for shock waves.\n\n\t<================================================>\n       /        Rich Sturges           (h) 703-536-4443   \\\n      /    NSWC - Carderock Division   (w) 301-227-1670    \\\n     /  \"I speak for no one else, and listen to the same.\"  \\\n    <========================================================>",

I sold my (well maintained)\n'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.\nAll that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings\nand seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers\nto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was\nmint.\n\n   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k\nmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.\nThere is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.\nI've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all\nsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.\n\n   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain\nit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my\nVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.\nProgressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.\n\nGood luck,\n\n _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________\n|                                                              |\n| Ken Snyder              ms/loc: 330 / UN2                    |\n| Hewlett-Packard Co.

        "content": "For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think\nabout airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\n\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\n\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n\tI've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.\n\n-TJK\n'85 FJ1100 with \"GET OUT OF MY WAY\" horns.\n\"That looks like a suit you'd fight a fire in\" -comment about the Aerostich",

But we know\nenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.\nThere are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over\nto begin a turn.\n\n\t1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.\n\n\t2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.\n\n\t3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a\n\ttorque which twists the bike over.\n\nTake an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,\n15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be\nneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each\neffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at\nhigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off\nbugger all, relatively speaking.\n\nBy the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to\nrun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast?

        "content": "I'm a biker and a dog-lover.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.\n\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\nless you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've\nlearned a few tricks I think...",

Same driver.  Same car.\nAbout two months apart.  \n\nObMoto:  The scary relevant part is that these people and I live on the type\nof twisty two lane that we all favor for riding- and I know damn well\nthat they can't see me on my bike, not if they couldn't see me in \nmy pickup.\n\n> Ryan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\n> KotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\n> DoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\n> ryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n> \n> \n>  * SLMR 2.1a * \"He's hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\n>                                                                              \n> ----\n> +===============================================================+\n> |COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n> |Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n> +===============================================================+\n\n\n\tThere's nothing like the pitter-patter of little feet,\n\tfollowed by the words \"Hey- you're not my Daddy!\"\n\n\t(Sorry- I had to do it just once)\n\t\n\n--\nDean Woodward         | \"You want to step into my world?\ndean@fringe.rain.com  |   It's a socio-psychotic state of Bliss...\"\n'82 Virago 920        |              -Guns'n'Roses, 'My World'\nDoD # 0866",

        "content": "Yo, Whaz up!!!\n\nEarlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\nI saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split-\nfires....\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\n\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\nor anything made, just stick 'em in.\n\nNow I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\n4's.        \n\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\nrunning for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\n\nPeace.\n\nWarren\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\"\n\nAt a local \"fix-er-up-er\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\ndumped ZX-7.  Then he asked the guy...\n\n\"What happened...\"   \"I dumped the clutch...\"\n\"How fast...\"        \"Pretty fast...\"\n\"Insurance...\"       \"Nope.\"\n\nThe fixer smiled.....\n\n\"What do you know about bikes?\"   \"Not much.....\"",

The limited steering\nlock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it.  The mirrors\nare very good, IMHO.

I have everything under control, I think, besides the\nbatteries. I know that if I buy a $50.00 Battery Tender for each one\nand leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage,\nthey'll be fine. But I'm not sure that's necessary. I've never heard\nanyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't\nso great. But maybe someone can tell me.\n\nWould it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the\nelectrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the\ncontainer, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? Then it\nwould seem that when the bikes come out of storage, I could put the\nelectrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully\ncharged. What's wrong with this?\n\nOn a related, but different note for you Bay Area Denizens, wasn't\nthere someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back? Who was\nit?

Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously\nsuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster\nor more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??\n\n\n>Mike, I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural\n>affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total\n>waste of time for you (assuming your total \"training\" hasn't come from\n>simply from reading rec.motorcycles).

This regardless of the amount of experience\n>they brought into the course (ranging from 10 minutes to 10+ years).\n\nFormal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include\ncountersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,\nfrom a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him\nat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,\nbut I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was \nright! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since\nthen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But\nthat's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\nit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\nor better as a result, is absurd.\n\nFormal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to\nbe able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering\ntheory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at\nthe time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.\nAnd that was my original point.\n\nMike",

I'm not suggesting that you should always\naim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the\nlimits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. \n\nIn any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep\nboth wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing\nexactly as *you* suggest!!",

Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call\nsome insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than\nyou might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)\n>\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nFor a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get\nboth feet on the ground when you stop.\n \nThe one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety\nFoundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion\nof such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you\nto ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.\n\nGood luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.\n\nAlan",

A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed\ngetoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)\nhit the pavement with a \"clunk\", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the\npaint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the\nhelmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a\nfiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.\nThis is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a\nwider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam\nliner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.\nThey told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination\nof the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or\noutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they\nwould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet\nwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would\ncompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.\n(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim\nprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity\ncan be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure\nis to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet\nmanufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point\nto consider when purchasing a lid.\n\n--\nKen Franklin \tThey say there's a heaven for people who wait\nAMA     \tAnd some say it's better but I say it ain't\nGWRRA           I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints\nDoD #0126       The sinners are lots more fun, Y'know only the good die young",

The point of formal training \nmust be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion\nto know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike \nin a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.\nCountersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among \nnew bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the \nmotorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the\ndirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.\nI have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she\nis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the \nmotorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right \nhandle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries\nto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.\n\nThe main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency \nsituations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of\ncountersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\n-- \nstaal@idt.unit.no",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.",

Assuming that the helmet/\nhead assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in\nthe other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's the\nthe liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were\ncracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area.

Of course it didn't have the initial power\nburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also\nhad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a \nbit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the\ntime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear\nin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was \nNO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of \"slip\" device in the shaft\nto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!\n\n  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane\ndo a \"stoppy\"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike \nup about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these\nactivities anymore (now that I'm an \"old guy\" with kids of my own) but\nit looked damn impressive!!\n\n  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed\nin that direction! :-)\n\nCheers, \nB**2",

Was\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\n\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz's famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\=@=/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    /\\\n                   /()\\   <-lobe\n                  / XX \\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems ->   / \\  / \\    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  <---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\nhistorians discount this story.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.\n                                                                                                          \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+",

I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's\n>more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat\n>in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8\" model).\n>\n>\tFYI, I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.\n\nA word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable\nlocks under the Kryptonite name.\n\nWhen I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite \nU-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for\na new lock for the bicycle.\n\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\n\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\n\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\ndon't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\n\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \ndark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the \nlock mechanism would stand up to an \"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\"\nattack.\n\nFourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to \ndeter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the\nweakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient\nyou can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go \nthrough the cable in well under a minute.\n\n\n\n-- \n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Michael Robinson                          UUCP:   ucbvax!cogsci!robinson\n                                        INTERNET: robinson@cogsci.berkeley.edu",

        "content": "Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!\n\n BACKGROUND\n ----------\n\n The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions \n devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad \n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\n motosports enthusiasts.\n\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\n\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \n\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\n ---------------------------------\n\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\n\n\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\n (depending on the topic). \n\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\n       list directly.\n \n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\n \n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\n\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\n ----------------------------------\n\n It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\n day.\n\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\n\n\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\n -----------------------\n\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\n\n\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\n (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\n based mail systems). \n\n BOUNCES\n -------\n\n Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce. \n\n OTHER LISTS \n -----------\n\n        Two-strokes:     2strokes@microunity.com\n        Harleys:         harley-request@thinkage.on.ca\n                         or  uunet!watmath!thinkage!harley-request\n        European bikes:  majordomo@onion.rain.com\n                         (in body of message write: subscribe euro-moto)\n\n\n thanks, be seeing you, \n Rich (race list administrator)\n\n rich@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n-- \nStefan Fielding-Isaacs                                415.822.5654 office/fax\ndba Art & Science              \"Books By Design\"      415.599.4876 voice/pager\nAMA/CCS #14\n* currently providing consulting writing services to: Gain Technology, Verity *",

I believe I discussed countersteering a horse\nbefore.\n\nBasically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and\nneck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and\nyou pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse\nby holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the\nhorse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a\nplow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins\nunder his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein\npulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit\n(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).\n\nAre you sorry you asked yet?\n\n---\nEd Green, former Ninjaite |I was drinking last night with a biker,\n  Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM   |and I showed him a picture of you.

One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go\nsomewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)\nyou can just detach and stow the pants. \n\nOne thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for\nmany women (with standard suits).

I kid you not.\n\nThis is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing\nlayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.\nMost helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner\ncompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or\ndelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years\nfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose\nup to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have\na video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.\n\nPuncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and\nother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of\n\"parking your lid\" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the\ncomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly\ndamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.\n--\nJerry Lotto <lotto@lhasa.harvard.edu>         MSFCI, HOGSSC, BCSO, AMA, DoD #18\nChemistry Dept., Harvard Univ.  \"It's my Harley, and I'll ride if I want to...\"",

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\n\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\n\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\n\nThird don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after \ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\nand balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\notherwise not in average shape.\n\nWith care, you should be ok.\n\n>The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for\n>a first time rider. I don't want to race; nor do I want to\n>ride cross country; nor do I want to ride on dirt trails. I'll\n>probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city\n>streets and freeways. The maximum I can spend is about $2500 so\n>I'll be looking at a used bike.\n\nI would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.\nSomething in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If\nyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\n\nPossible models: \nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier \nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.\n\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\n\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know\nthem as well.\n\nFor mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.\n\nHope this helps,\n-David\n(dagibbs@qnx.com)",

        "content": "Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\n-- \n\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \t\t\t\tXyvision Color Systems\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\t\t101 Edgewater Drive\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\t\t\t\tWakefield MA\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\t\t018801285",

It's as much your job to keep her on the pillion as it is hers,\nand I guarantee she'll be put off by the bike ripping out from under her\nwhen you whack it open.  Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time\nout too.  You and her need to learn each other's body English.  She needs\nto learn what your idea is about how to take the turn, and you need to\nlearn her idea of \"shit!  Don't crash now!\" so you don't work at cross\npurposes while leaned over.

        "content": "Hola amigos,\n\nQuiero... I need an answer to a pressing question.  I now own two\nbikes and would love to keep them both.  One is a capable and\nsmooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great\nbrakes; the other is a Beemer G/S, kind of rough for the city but\ngreat on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, but\nI don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is going\nto pluck me by the short hairs.  \n\nUnless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  They\ndo this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of \ndriving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage\nto straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left...\naccelerate the Zephyr; turn right... accelerate the Beemer.)  Does\nanybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to\ndiscount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.\n\nBy the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes\nthere, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebody\nguesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson\nthey only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,\nper annum.\n\nMuchas gracias,\n\t\t\tEnrique",

We'll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan't really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I've picked out.\n\nHere's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and\n\t  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!\n--\nDON'T DRINK SOAP!

We'll be riding some twisty, \n> fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n> \n\n\nAn extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.\n\nOwww.\n\nWell, I hate to be a wet sock, but, well...\n\nI was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started\nriding myelf, and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  The passenger\nseats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't\neven usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my\nback by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the\nreasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had\na BMW. :)\n\nI'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains\nor some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.\n\nThe best advice I'd give a beginning passenger:\n\n- Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort\n  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on \n  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop\n  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.\n\n- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider\n  asks you to :)\n\n- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements\n  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,\n  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.\n\n- Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably\n  consistent shifting style).  Avoid \"helmet bonk.\"  Helmet bonk is \n  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change\n  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It\n  gets old real fast.\n\n- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep\n  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands\n  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,\n  but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.\n\n- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be \n  sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're\n  still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.\n\n- Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or\n  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed \n  for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************",

The battery held a charge and\nenergetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just\nsitting.\n\nEventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun\nwasn't strong enough due to its low angle.\n\nI think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more\nexpensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.\n\nI've never used it on the bike because I have an E-Z Charger on it and\nkeep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.\n\nArnie Skurow",

Hence, any apparent\n>similarity in handling characteristics may, or may *not* be analagous\n>in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling\n>characteristics.\n\nOK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.\n\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\n\nI've        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV\n     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca\n                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada",

(BTW, as of a\ncouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750\nGSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that\nmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-\norder types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily\nby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep \nthem honest about acquiring parts. \n\nFor Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a\nHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.\nDitto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are\nnot as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the \nplastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,\nthen, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it\non a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,\nmore traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.\n\nMike\n-- \nDisclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^?\nexit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save/quit :!QUIT\n^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^# ^E ^X ^I ^T ? help  helpquit ^D  ^d !!\nman help ^C ^c :e! help exit ?Quit ?q CtrlShftDel \"Hey, what does Stop L1A d...\"",

When it runs, it runs well. \n> \nGood point, did not catch this in the original post. The only other things \nwhich come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this.\nThe fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let\nsuppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the\nvacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough\nto open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, \nsince the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, \nand as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. \n\nOne way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side \npanels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the \ncorrect size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output\nside of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make\nsure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum \nto the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check \nfor air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is\na vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it \nflows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in \nthe vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog \nor partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced \nto fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control\nhose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.\n\nNow if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there \nis something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, \nI would be typing all day to list them all! \n\nHere are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve\nand open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the\nairbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are\nquite a few on each carb.\n\nI hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American\nHonda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and\ncall the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE. It is a 800 number, but I don't recall\nit off the top of my head. I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days\nlater a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked\nthe support I received, here would be your chance to tell them what you think!\n\nBuy the service manual on the F2, it is an invaluable source of information\nfor working on your bike and I might add, trouble shooting!",

Keep the bike in\n1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for\nengaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.\n\nWhen the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side\nof the car in front of you.

So please tell us what you are talking about.  We can't\neven protect against an assault, or discuss methods, if you don't come out\nwith it.\n\nSee, I have heard the ones about the pipes, and the liquid nitrogen, and the\ncordless Dremel tools, and a bunch of other ones.  The most plausable method\n(I am not a bike thief, so I really don't know for certain) is just to put\na rod through each wheel, and use four guys to just lift the bike into a\ntruck.  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything.\nSince that method is so childishly easy, I figure a nice, visible chain or\ncable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on\nto the next bike.\n\n(Hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours!  :-)\n\n|Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off\n|by such a trival tactic.

If we don't know what you are talking about,\nwe can't very well guard against it, can we?\n\nFor my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm\nwith pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, C&C\ninsurance, and I try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of people\nabout.  (See, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of\nstealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious,\nthey'll set off the alarm.)\n\nThat's for a nice bike.  For a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its\nactual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would\nWANT to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make\na profit on the deal.  :-)\n\nSeriously, if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week,\nand (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking,\nbut useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a\ncurb bumper in the parking lot under the light.  I usually rig the cable\nlocks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or\nthe cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off.  And I have a friend\ncome buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there.  The\nonly thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over \nwinter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm).\n\nOh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and\nplace them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off.\n\nThat's the best that I can think of.  Most of the locks I see people put\non bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound.  I like ABUS, since I have\npersonally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot.\n\nDave Svoboda (svoboda@void.rtsg.mot.com)    | \"I'm getting tired of\n90 Concours 1000 (Mmmmmmmmmm!)              |  beating you up, Dave.\n84 RZ 350 (Ring Ding) (Woops!)              |  You never learn.\"\nAMA 583905  DoD #0330  COG 939  (Chicago)   |  -- Beth \"Bruiser\" Dixon",

Suggestions?\n\nGlad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding for\nabout two years, but here are my rules for traffic light survival:\n\n     - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have\n       to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the\n       car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I\n       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my\n       visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your\n       taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright\n       white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)\n\n     - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually\n       about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give\n       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.\n\n     - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors\n       *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see\n       any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out\n       of the way *now!*\n\n     - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line, I\n       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from\n       behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-).\n       I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice\n       that there's something in the lane ahead of him.\n\nNow, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line\nthat I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line, your forward escape\nroute is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that\nyou don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line\n(although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up \nnext to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decided\nthat hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.\nAny other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind\nyou?\n\n-rob.\n\n--\nRob Griffiths  | Erasure.ShonaLaing.WildSwans.B52s.U2.JudyBats.REM.Smiths\nrobg@apple.com |  FAA Certified cloud basher  I wanna drive the Zamboni!",

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,\nnot to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.\nThe non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.\n\nI personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.\nThe first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.\nThis has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I\ncontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\n\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\nto my use and flamage in general.\n\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may\nbe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily\nweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor\napplicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a\nflatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your \nmotorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyone\nwho looks like you, too.\n\n\n-----\nTommy McGuire\nmcguire@cs.utexas.edu\nmcguire@austin.ibm.com\n\n\"...I will append an appropriate disclaimer to outgoing public information,\nidentifying it as personal and as independent of IBM....\"",

This may be due\nin part to the fact that neither I, nor my regular passengers, are\nparticularly slimline !\n\nI always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes\ntheir movements predictable.\n\nMy regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,\nI don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.\nAgain that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers\n(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,\nmaking any kind of maneuvering difficult.\n\nI've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and\nshifts their weight a bit.

        "content": "Unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter\nand Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT.\n\nIt came with no instructions, but it came 2 weeks earlier than they\nsaid it would.  Installation would have been very easy, but the seat\nfastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with\nthe stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured that\nout, the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest, though,\ndoes not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the \nbackrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, \nhard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a\na soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.\n\nThe driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable\nenough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat\nwithout a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the \nvolume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it\nseems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit, but I've not \nhas enough time to really test it.  The backrest also comes with a \nsmall pocket.  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the \n10\" taller seat.\n\nIf I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville, Pinkham & Smugglers),\nI'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an\nimprovement.\n-- \n\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \t\t\t\tXyvision Color Systems\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\t\t101 Edgewater Drive\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\t\t\t\tWakefield MA\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\t\t018801285",

        "content": "Hello Folks,\n\nI'm very happy with my \"new\" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...\nthat's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting\nsomething rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much\nanyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a \ntorque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still\n(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe\nI don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion\na little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are \nmy questions:\n\n1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the\nwind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds\n(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my\nvision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece \ndetachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.\n\n2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the\ncrash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming\nout from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so\nthat you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it \nreally picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the \nheadlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators\ndon't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm\nputtering around in the dirt at low RPM?  \n\n3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing\nin the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section\nof the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? \n\n4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline\nwith alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep\nthe engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any \nparticular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?\n\nThanks,\n\n/-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\\\n|                                                                |\n|     DoD# 88888           asphaug@hindmost.lpl.arizona.edu      |\n| '90 Kawi 550 Zephyr               (Erik Asphaug)               |\n|  '86 BMW R80GS                                                 |\n\\-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/",

Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the\nOwners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by\nthe by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:\n\n\"Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to\na combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.\n\n    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's\nstatement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with\nthe word \"undertiding\" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement\nof his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a\ngrossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does\nnot just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the \nprocess.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps\nyou intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.\n     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would\nbe most appreciative that when tou call me an \"asshole\" you remind the\nletter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost\nguaranteed to have woeful consequences.\n   With kind regards, I remain,\n                                 Robert Higdon\n\nO.K.

The stuff seems to work, and it doesn't\nattract grundge like PJ-1 Blue does. I gave it the acid test, a full\nday's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the\nsand dunes. If there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with\nsand at the end of the day, but the chain looked pretty clean.\n\nAs far as mail-order goes, if Chaparral has it in stock (and they can\ntell you if it's in stock, or about how long it will take to back-order\nit if it's not), I usually get it in three days. Competition Accessories\nalways seems to take a week or two to deliver.

MAW was\nabout $30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots, but on\nMonday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week, so I asked MAW a\ncompletely unreasonable question: \"Do you have them in stock?\" The\nconversation went something like this:\n\nI need to know if you have some boots in stock.\n\n\tDo you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard?\n\nI want to know if you have them in stock.\n\n\tWell, the computer doesn't show anything, I'd have to call the\n\tdistributer to find out if we have them.\n\nSo do you have them or not?\n\n\tDon't you understand what I'm saying? I have to call our\n\tdistributer to find out if we have them in stock or not.\n\nUh, right. So can you do it?\n\n\tYea, call me back in an hour, and ask for Phil.\n\nSo an hour later Phil isn't there, but Mike says he'll check, and call\nhim back in half an hour. Half an hour later Mike isn't there either,\nbut he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month\n(3 weeks away). Screw it, the 30 bucks isn't worth the hassle. I called\nChaparral and asked if they had them in stock:\n\n\tOoh, Alpinestars? Probably not, they are hard to keep in stock,\n\tbut I'll check. What size?\n\nSize 10.\n\n\tLet's see, yes! Size 10, in blue & white, gray & white, black...\n\nI'll take the blacks!\n\nThis was about noon on Monday, they arrived Thursday morning. Once\nagain, three days via UPS ground.

The grips are really nice to have in winter,\nand aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'.\nThis has been complained about by every reviewer, official and\nunofficial, that's ever talked about these grips.  The 'high' setting\nis often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things\njust get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable\neffect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature\nabout right.

The \"official line\" in MSF\ncurricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying\nboth brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and\nboth tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to\nprevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more\ntraction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to\nweight shift.\n\nThe \"official line\" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face\nof it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage\nof all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the\navailable braking power by using only the front at time 0.\n\n>>Saying, \"brake until the tire just begins to slide\" is next to useless\n>>advice to a newbie.

I agree that totally locking the front occasionally\nmakes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an\nexperienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like\nCode used to use.\n\n>In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep\n>both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing\n>exactly as *you* suggest!!\n\nTrue, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills\n(which is how this discussion started), \"keep both wheels just on the\npoint of sliding\" is nearly useless information.

        "content": "My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or\nsomething. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\n\nI eagerly await comment.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He's hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\n                                                                                       \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+",

        "subject": "Guzzi 850-T tires, plus fairing question",
        "content": "I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the\nbottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the\n46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have\nlarge, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get\nthem :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\nwaist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\n\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\nin some way different from us real folks.\n\nAlso, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\nI've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...\n\nAs far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\n\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,\nI still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I\nown.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.\n\nKen Wallich <wallich@ncd.com> \nken@wallich.com ~ kmw@al.org ~ [...]decwrl!vixie!amber!ken\n--\nKen Wallich <wallich@ncd.com> \nken@wallich.com ~ kmw@al.org ~ [...]decwrl!vixie!amber!ken",

Thank you for your support.\n\nSpring break, I went through the four corners area and back.  The most\nbeautiful stop I made was in Utah at the Needles Overlook.  Though this\nis a bit further east than where you appear to be going, I highly\nrecommend it.  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon.  It\nwas not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was\nheading north from Monticello).  In order to get to the right place, I\nshould clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation\narea.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may\nhave been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is\nabout 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles\noverlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably\nmaintained (I ran it about 70mph).\n\nLooking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on \nthe world.  If it isn't too far out of your way, you should see it.\n\n\nDan Martin         |     \"I can't stand this proliferation of paperwork.\nmartind@spot       |      Its useless to fight the forms.\n                   |\n                   |      You've got to kill the people producing them.\"\n.colorado.edu      |           -Vladimir P.

        "content": "A few months ago, in one the the motorcycle mags, there was\nan article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to\nbe available thru BMW.  The idea was that the tape would look\nblack in sunlight, and reflect in other colors at night to\nheadlights.  It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime \nvisibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction.\n\nI talked to the local BMW dealer about this.  I was told that the \nonly thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being \nused in a coming line of BMW clothing (rainsuits).  He wasn't aware \nof anything regarding self applied tape.\n\nHas anyone come across this from BMW or any other source?\n\nThanks,\n\n---\nSteve Bunis,  Sun Microsystems     ***DoD #0795***\t93-ST1100\n              Itasca, IL\t  ***AMA #682049***\t78-KZ650",

Soaked and cold by the time I got \nhome.\n \n Since I didn't have another set of thermals which were dry, I said \"to heck \nwith it\" and drove my cage back up.\n \n Lo and Behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm \nyellow thing I haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was 10 minutes \ninto the trip.\n \n And me in my cage. Oh JOY.\n \n \n Happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the \nbike when I first got it, put on an EMGO replacement mirror... hated it the \nentire time that thing was on my bike because I couldn't see a DAMNED thing \nthrough it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you \nget a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur)... And I got a replacement windshield for my \nfairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but \nannoying)... so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing \nthem this afternoon.\n \n 'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ('75 CB360T) is the damned \n\"2 D-Cell Flashlight\" headlight.\n \n Has anyone seen a good source for ~25 watt halogen passing lights? Since \nthe charging system on the CB360T can't handle continuous use of a 50W \nhalogen headlight, I was thinking about putting a couple passing lights \non... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding I do, \nbut wouldn't drain the battery during \"normal use\" (chiefly day trips and \ncommuting to work and back)...",

Do share the details.\n\n\tHOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55\n\nIt's simple.  First, it has to be the first really nice riding day\nof spring.  The bike is back together again, and so are you.  Grab\nall your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premium\nor better.  Head out.\n\n\tIn Ames, there is a road that leads to the little town of\nGilbert.  Gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something.\nHaving just gotten the bike back together, I thought I'd take it\nfor a short ride and check things out.  Heading out of town, I\nwent into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit,\nand started leaning around.  The pace quickened as everything felt\njust right.  Finally, the road straightened and I was ready for a\nbit of speed.  Grab third gear, open her up.  At roughly 90mph\ngrab fourth gear.  Look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail\nto notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twist\nthe throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see\njust how well she's been put back together.\n\n\tAt 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was\nflexing a bit.  Thus, I slowed, pulled off the road, removed my\nhelmet and gloves, unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny\npack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper\npulled in all hot and flustered.\n\n\t\"Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going?\"\n\"Not precisely, no.  I was paying attention to the bike and road,\nnot the instruments.  I just got her back together last night, and\nI'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic.\"\n\t\"My radar says you were at over 145mph.  Care to tell me why\nI shouldn't give you a ticket?\"\n\"Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and\ntraffic, on a strait and flat road, while wearing all the protective\ngear that safety demands?\" (note: I wasn't quite that eloquent)\n\t\"Say, what kind of bike is that, anyway?\"\n<I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750, a Rat Bike>\n\t\"Yeah, I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years.\"\n<compare riding stories>\n<pack toolkit, having tightened that fender>\n\t\"So why were you out here?\"\n\"I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through\nme.  If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone, I'm dead.  If it holds\nup out here, then I know it will work right in traffic.  I do this\nevvery year when I rebuild her.\"\n\t\"Not any more.  You'll find a better place than *my* highway\nto do those speeds.  If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highway\nagain I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can.  Now get\nout of my sight before I write you a ticket.\"\n\"Yes, officer.\"\n\t\"And kid, keep your eyes open out there...\" <drives off>\n\n\tAnd that, in a nut-shell, is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55.\nI don't guarantee that it will work for you, but it worked for me.\n\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

I'll tell you \nwhat we've found and the systems we've worked out.\n\n- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the rider\nto judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something\nand leaning forward.  Remember this.\n\n- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally \nthis means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned\nover and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.\nMuch balance is lost and this can be dangerous.\n\n- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough \nfor the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding \nonto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fast\nbecause braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which \nshoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.\n\n- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not \nout wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.\n\n- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.\nNormally this means \"slow down, and do it now!\".  \n\n\n> turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional\n> signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???\n\nWe only have a couple signals.  \"Slow down\" is her either tapping me on \nthe back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency\nof the matter :-)\n\n\"Turn here\" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is\nalso the sign for \"cool!  Look at that.\"  \"I hafta pee\" is the same sign\nas \"turn here\".  \"I'm hungry\" is the same sign.  \"Go faster\" is usually\ndone by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see \"slow\ndown\" more often than \"go faster\".\n \n> I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that\n> she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...\n\nThe best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and \npillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're \nin almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because\nyou as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely\nfeel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes\nat any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  \nPillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.\n\nAlso, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up\nthan by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and\n\"in the Zen of the moment\" less.  Remember this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n   Pat Loughery [patlo@microsoft.com] Seattle, WA\n\t DoD #393, AMA, VME, DIOC, 1KSI=2.53\n '91 VFR750F, '91 Nighthawk 750, '82 Seca 650 Turbo\n\t\t^^^ For Sale\n----------------------------------------------------",

Not when you stop at a STOP\nsign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the\npegs until you tell her to get off the bike.\n\nb) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough\nthat she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And\n(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as\npossible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your\nballs up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.\n\nc) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't\nlean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.\nDon't look over your shoulder.*\n\n3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That\nmeans don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than\nusual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have\nthe equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,\nso be prepared for that.\n\n4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't\nhave to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.\n\n5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things\nof interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get\nso focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives\nher ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.\n\n* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended \"look over the rider's\nshoulder in curves\" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of\nher weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,\nunlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the\npillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain\nperpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someone\nelse on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.\n-- \nCurtis Jackson\t   cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com\t'91 Hawk GT\t'81 Maxim 650\nDoD#0721 KotB  '91 Black Lab mix \"Studley Doright\"  '92 Collie/Golden \"George\"\n\"There is no justification for taking away individuals' freedom\n in the guise of public safety.\" -- Thomas Jefferson",

So, I stuff in a bit\n   of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best \"gun-gum\"  and\n   come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a\n   brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?

I found I was overdoing\nit (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after\nspreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not\nthe usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so\nthey were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the\nadjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right\namount of Zipper Squish (TM).\n\n>Result: I now know that noplace in Spokane will even _consider_ trying\n>to repair a broken zipper-closer-thingy, which must be a $0.30 part\n>which needs a $20 tool to install.\n\nI've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the\nAccessory Ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of\ncharge.

I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line.\n(Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  If I can't\nsplit (perhaps there isn't room) then I will stop near one side of the\nlane so I have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next\ncar has stopped.  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure\nit will!  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to\nstop, I haven't had to find out yet.  Some cars have an annoying habbit\nof racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to\ntell if they are planning to brake or not!\n\nSo in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch your\nmirrors until it's all clear.\n-- \nPaul Thompson    Apple Computer",

        "content": "Yesterday, a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle\ndealer. It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myself\nhave never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience\nof that visit and of an observation of \"SQUILDLY\" behavior by other \ncustomers and/or sales personel:\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nI ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into \"cruiser\" type bikes. My\nfriend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He\nwanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer\nthat sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. \n\nThe place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few \nIntruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.\n\nWell the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I \nmoseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.\nI could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40),\nbut I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured\nto each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs\nfirmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the \"hormone gang\"\ntalking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big\ndeal.\n\nHere is the part that concerned me. The \"HG\" and those shop personel that were\nnot busy with customers went back out, where said \"HG\" members fired up their\nrides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,\none decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.\n\nSQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager\nnot only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they\nwere betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely\nas he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her\n\"pilot\" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers\ncould be heard as well as felt.\n\nI felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those\nin cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and\ndamning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little\nuncomfortable and we left. \n\nI will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my\nanger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open\nmind and doesn't associate me with them. \n\nBTW, I can't afford a new bike.....",

At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much if\nat all.  The alternators put out sufficient wattage, it just that you need\nto be at 4K RPM to get it.  \n\n>3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing\n>in the morning.

Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the\nthrottle.  It should fire.  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle.\nMy R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle.\n\nIt's an EXPERIENCE thing.  Like Zen, it's hard to describe.  It can be hard\nto learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success\nand failure.  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the\nbattery while trying to get it to run.\n\nIf my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while to\nstart.  If it doesn't, I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to\nvaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off.  I've got dual\nplugs which make it easier to start.\n\n>4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline\n>with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep\n>the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any \n>particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?\n\nThe BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit.  It's good for a few MPG and the\nparts are alcohol proof.  The parts it replaces aren't alcohol proof.  As\nlong as the bike isn't going to sit for long periods of time, gasohol is\nnice since it helps keep ping away.  If your bike doesn't ping on cheap gas\nyou ought to raise the compression! (Half a smiley, the BMW twins of the\n80s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the EPA happy.  Dual plugs\nand higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance).\n\nNeil Kirby      DoD #0783       nak@archie.cbusa.att.com\nAT&T Bell Labs  Columbus OH     USA (614) 860-5304\nIf you think I speak for AT&T you might have more lawyers than sense.",

        "content": "My first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run.\nA big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes I was riding with and tried \nto bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. He kicked the dog a \ncouple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dog\nangrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then started\nafter yours truly. At the time, I had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell)\nand as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike, I\npulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of\nthe pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell)\nand he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either. \n\nMy second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. I wasn't paying \nvery close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the\ncarcass. I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I \njust held onto the handlebars and freaked out. Both wheels went squarely over\nthe dog's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4\nlumber. The bike didn't lose any stability at all and I kept on going. After\nI got to my destination, I found bits of fur, meat, and blood stuck to\nthe bottom of my motor and frame...... gross.\n-- \n=============================================================================\nNeal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX)\n\t      doh #0000001200   |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org\n\t      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's.\n         \"Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps\n          we shall learn the truth.\" -- August Kekule' (1890)\n=============================================================================",

I don't see many people using slip-on's\n>but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive.\n>\n>Thanks!\n>Dave\n>\n\nCost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most \ninstances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more \nperformance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.\nThe mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at \n2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of \nthe slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose\nto but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...\nAnyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,\nwhich is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario \nslip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full \nthrottle.\n\nJust remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or\nexhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may\nhave to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust\nsystem, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point\nwhich re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping\nprofile.\n\nTalk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if\nthey have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the\nsystem also to see what they think about there slip on.\n\nAlso, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on a\ngroup of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a \nside bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at\nthe rear wheel, 85 verses 91. \n\nBuyer beware, of outrageous claimed increases in horse power!

With Lissa's permission, I have usurped the title of\nKotWitDoDFAQ.

If you're feeling\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\nthat you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\n\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\nnet, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.\n\nBy now you're probably asking \"So who's the KotL already?\". Well, as\nJohn Sloan notes below, that's about the only real \"secret\" left around\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\nKotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\nDead-Head.\n\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\n\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\ne-mail address. For example:\n\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\n\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\nrequirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\n\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\n\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]\n\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \nargue with each other and plan rides together.\n\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\n\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it's the file name for \nthe group's primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \nto as the DoD.\n\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\n\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, Norway and Finland.\n\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\n\nAs often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \nDoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's \n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \n\"Joust.\"\n\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\n\nThough it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to \nget together.  Long may they flame.\n\n\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\t[centerbar]\n\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \nability and your cat.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\n\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\n\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\nwomen inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\nhalls of academe for generations. \n\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \n\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\nthe funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\nnumber. \n\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\nminded enough to accept us as members. \n\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \n\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \n\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\nincludes name, state, and email address. \n\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \n\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\n\n\tChuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\n \n\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \n              :-(  x    / /         \\ \\    x   )-:     \n             :-(  x    / / -\\-----/- \\ \\    x   )-:    \n            :-(  L     | \\/  \\   /  \\/ |     F   )-:   \n            :-(  I     | /    \\ /    \\ |     L   )-:   \n            :-(  V     \\/ __   /   __ \\/     A   )-:   \n            :-(  E     / /  \\     /  \\ \\     M   )-:   \n            :-(        | |   \\   /   | |     E   )-:   \n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \n            :-(  O     | \\___// \\\\___/ |     T   )-:   \n            :-(         \\     \\_/     /      O   )-:   \n            :-(  F       \\___     ___/           )-:   \n            :-(  L        \\ \\     / /        L   )-:   \n            :-(  A         \\ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \n             :-(  x        \\_______/        x   )-:    \n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      The DoD\n\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\n \nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples?

Quist   DoD #94\n\n\n[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call\nChuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,\nwith 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] \n\n(editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at\nthe First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens\nreferring to each other as \"Chuck\". I guess you had to be there. I\nwasn't.) \n\nChuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,\n cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,\n may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted\n to live a man's life,\n[Music slowly builds in background]\n riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes\n and the deepest valleys,\n living the life of a Motorcyclist;\n doing donuts and evading the police;\n terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;\n eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,\n\n\tI Want to be      A Denizen!\n\n[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with\nfringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of\nan obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels\nsit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,\nshowering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil\non the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat\nBoy.] \n\nChuck [Sings to the tune of \"The Lumberjack Song\"]:\n\nI'm a Denizen and I'm okay,\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:\nHe's a Denizen and he's okay,\nHe flames all night and he rides all day.\n\nI ride my bike;\nI eat my lunch;\nI go to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays I ride Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus]:\nHe rides his bike;\nHe eats his lunch;\nHe goes to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays he rides Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\n'Cause He's a Denizen...\n\nI ride real fast,\nMy name is Chuck,\nIt somehow seems to fit.\nI over-rate the worst bad f*ck,\nBut like a real good sh*t.\n\nOh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\nOh, He's a Denizen...\n\nI wear high heels\nAnd bright pink shorts,\n full leathers and a bra.\nI wish I rode a Harley,\n just like my dear mama.\n\n[Chorus refrain]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    Why you have to be killed.\n\nWell, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed\nto read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started\nas a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\n\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\nstand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\nto the occasion and replied:\n\n\"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.\"\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\nknown) include:\n\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\t\tDoers of Donuts\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\t\tDebasers of Daughters\nDickweeds of Denver\t\t\tDriveway of Death\nDebauchers of Donuts\t\t\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\n\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\nlimited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\n\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\n\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\n\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\nto use the archive.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nVia ftp:\n\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\n\nVia e-mail:\n\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\n\ndir [dod]\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\n\nand you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\n\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\nthe next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of\n50K each; not a good idea.\n-- \nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\n\n**********************************************************\n\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Patches? What patches?\n\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That's sick!\", or\nperhaps \"That's sick! I want!\"\n\nWell, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\nthere's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\nnews is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\nsomeone says \"I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\nthis is anarchy in action.\n\nHere's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\npopular demand].\n\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\nyou'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\n\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\n\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\nthe other day.\n\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\n\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\nDenizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is\nnow $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude\nto all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently\nbeing prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to \nsee the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,\nI will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank \nyou for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the\nmuseum, and the fulfillment of its goals.\n\n                                Sincerely,\n\n\n                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395\n                                Director\n\nP.S.

Over $5500  [Arnie]\n \n                        Organized (?) Rides:\n\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\n\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\n2-strokes.  And though it's not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\nto gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.\nEuropean Denizens have staged some gathers too.

Twenty\nminutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty\npresented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror\nand a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack\nand masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the\nbike.\n\nI'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly\nafterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty\ntold me he ran the charge through in December and that it went\nuncontested.\n\n\n-- \nStephen Manes\t\t\t\t\t   manes@magpie.linknet.com\nManes and Associates\t\t\t\t   New York, NY, USA  =o&>o",

Now, at\nfirst I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),\nbut I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,\nthe gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like \n900RR gauges.

Or should I just work with \"If I drink tonight, I\n>don't ride until tomorrow\"?\n\nThis thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court\na few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and\nplea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity\nto listen to some of the \"creative excuses\" offered the judge by others.\n\nAfter listening to a number of \"Well, I was passing a very slow truck\nthat suddenly speed up\" versions, I decided that the judge had heard\njust about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than\nimpressed with any of them.\n\nThis young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a\nrather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.\nHe was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph\nzone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had\nalcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.\n\nThe judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose\nand said in his sternest voice: \"Well son, those are some pretty\nfast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for\nyour self?\"\n\n\"Well Sir\", meekly the defenant replied, \"I just was over to my\nbuddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home.\"\nHe offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and\nwas doing 110 mph on his way home.\n\nThe judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the\nmaximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him\nto attend remedial drivers training school.\n\nIsn't America Great??\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBill Mohrman                                         81-CB900C\nMotorola , SPS\nColumbus, OH\n------------------- Disclaimers Apply ------------------------------",

Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity\nto highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended\nthat manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function\nprovided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the\ngas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the \nrider doesn't.

I left out a step or two, but you get the idea.  If you\ncan make it convincing, theoretically you're supposed to win.\n  I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken.  I did get to see\nsome other poor biker try it.

Keep\nin mind cops do this all the time, and their word is better than yours.\nMaybe, though, they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time.\nBesides, this guy didn't speak English very well, and ended up absolutely\nconfounding the judge, the cop, and everyone else in the room who'd been\nrecently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota.\n  Ahem.

        "content": "My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding\njacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would\nlike to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.\n\nI'm considering two basic options:\n\n1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs\n    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.\n    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\n\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\n    than upper Aerostich.\n\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out \nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\n\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\n\nSteve\n--\n-- \n Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu\n (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu\n 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250\n \"Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry...\"",

No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance.

This is\n  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had\n  any problems with it.\n\n  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than \n  a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better \n  suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non\n  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.\n  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear\n  changes.\n  \n  The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike\n  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a\n  custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect\n  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced \n  by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up\n  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better\n  ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.\n\n  So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg,\n  which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.",

Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse\n D'Elegance and more.\n \n \tThis is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the \n event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,\n \"The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more\n complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our\n two most favrite highways- Highway 70, which goes through the Feather River\n Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's\n Highway 49.\"\n \n \tDay passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a \n pre-registered guest of a BMW rider.\n \t\n \tThe Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89,\n two miles South of downtown Quincy.\n \n \tFor pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug\n Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA\n 94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195\n\n ADDITIONAL NOTES:: \n   This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.\n   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one\n   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so\n   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.\n\n   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.\n   For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa, \n   Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.\n   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.\n   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. \n   Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early\n   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays\n   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday\n   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the\n   awards ceremony.  \n\n   For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on \n   registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course\n   be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider < betting 70 +\n   needed to win> and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15>.\n   and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.",

Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement.\n\nIt made for interesting cups of coffee, anyhow.  We would plot routes that\ncontained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to\nget the water to boiling point.  This is sometimes difficult in England.\n\nGood luck on your quest.\n--\n\nNick (the Biker)   DoD 1069   Concise Oxford\n\nM'Lud.\n\n  ___\t___   ___   ___\n {\"_\"} {\"_\"} {\"_\"} {\"_\"}\t  Nick Pettefar, Contractor@Large.\n  ' `\t` '   ' `   ` '\t\t  Currently incarcerated at BNR,\n  ___\t___   ___   ___\t\t  Maidenhead, The United Kingdom.\n |\"_\"| |\"_\"| |\"_\"| |\"_\"|\t  npet@bnr.ca  '86 BMW K100RS \"Kay\"\n  ` '\t' `   ` '   ' `\t\t  Pres.

Everybody's got an\nopinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is\nextremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't\nknow.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code\nonly tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a\nwide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any\nadvice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.\n\nIf you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,\nstudy it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really\nhappens.  Read \"Fight Your Ticket\" too, but don't miss the little\nsection at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're\nbasically screwed.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here in\nCalifornia.

Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can't wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks |\n| '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

At a tuned engine rpm, the\nstacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air\nrushing in.\nAir momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of\nthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside\nlong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.\nShock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from\nescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion\nchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)\nto the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they\ndesign for shock waves.\n\n\t<================================================>\n       /        Rich Sturges           (h) 703-536-4443   \\\n      /    NSWC - Carderock Division   (w) 301-227-1670    \\\n     /  \"I speak for no one else, and listen to the same.\"  \\\n    <========================================================>",

I sold my (well maintained)\n'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.\nAll that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings\nand seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers\nto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was\nmint.\n\n   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k\nmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.\nThere is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.\nI've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all\nsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.\n\n   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain\nit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my\nVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.\nProgressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.\n\nGood luck,\n\n _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________\n|                                                              |\n| Ken Snyder              ms/loc: 330 / UN2                    |\n| Hewlett-Packard Co.

        "content": "For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think\nabout airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\n\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\n\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n\tI've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

But we know\nenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.\nThere are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over\nto begin a turn.\n\n\t1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.\n\n\t2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.\n\n\t3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a\n\ttorque which twists the bike over.\n\nTake an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,\n15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be\nneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each\neffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at\nhigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off\nbugger all, relatively speaking.\n\nBy the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to\nrun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running\ngroup where we could start \"counter-footing\" arguments and have them\nall falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?\n-- \nChris Malcolm    cam@uk.ac.ed.aifh          +44 (0)31 650 3085\nDepartment of Artificial Intelligence,    Edinburgh University\n5 Forrest Hill, Edinburgh, EH1 2QL, UK                DoD #205",

        "content": "I'm a biker and a dog-lover.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.\n\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\nless you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've\nlearned a few tricks I think...",

        "content": "Yo, Whaz up!!!\n\nEarlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\nI saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split-\nfires....\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\n\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\nor anything made, just stick 'em in.\n\nNow I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\n4's.        \n\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\nrunning for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\n\nPeace.\n\nWarren\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\"\n\nAt a local \"fix-er-up-er\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\ndumped ZX-7.  Then he asked the guy...\n\n\"What happened...\"   \"I dumped the clutch...\"\n\"How fast...\"        \"Pretty fast...\"\n\"Insurance...\"       \"Nope.\"\n\nThe fixer smiled.....\n\n\"What do you know about bikes?\"   \"Not much.....\"",

He said it took two fingers on that measely\nsingle front disk to accomplish the task.  How much more brake do\nyou need?\n\n>As such, it's somewhat large and overweight for its motor.

The limited steering\nlock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it.  The mirrors\nare very good, IMHO.

I have everything under control, I think, besides the\nbatteries. I know that if I buy a $50.00 Battery Tender for each one\nand leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage,\nthey'll be fine. But I'm not sure that's necessary. I've never heard\nanyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't\nso great. But maybe someone can tell me.\n\nWould it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the\nelectrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the\ncontainer, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? Then it\nwould seem that when the bikes come out of storage, I could put the\nelectrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully\ncharged. What's wrong with this?\n\nOn a related, but different note for you Bay Area Denizens, wasn't\nthere someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back? Who was\nit?

Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously\nsuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster\nor more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??\n\n\n>Mike, I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural\n>affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total\n>waste of time for you (assuming your total \"training\" hasn't come from\n>simply from reading rec.motorcycles).

This regardless of the amount of experience\n>they brought into the course (ranging from 10 minutes to 10+ years).\n\nFormal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include\ncountersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,\nfrom a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him\nat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,\nbut I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was \nright! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since\nthen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But\nthat's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\nit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\nor better as a result, is absurd.\n\nFormal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to\nbe able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering\ntheory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at\nthe time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.\nAnd that was my original point.\n\nMike",

I'm not suggesting that you should always\naim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the\nlimits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. \n\nIn any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep\nboth wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing\nexactly as *you* suggest!!",

Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call\nsome insurance companies for rates.

And a bike short enough to get\nboth feet on the ground when you stop.\n \nThe one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety\nFoundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion\nof such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you\nto ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.\n\nGood luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.\n\nAlan",

Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.\n\nThe mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405\nfreeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped\nresponding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make \nmy way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then\nby pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did\nnot mind stopping for me.\n\nTurned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40 \ncarb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws\ntight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that\non the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadside\nfixable and I was on my way in hardly any time.\n____________________________________________________________________________\n   Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed\ngetoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)\nhit the pavement with a \"clunk\", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the\npaint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the\nhelmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a\nfiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.\nThis is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a\nwider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam\nliner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.\nThey told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination\nof the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or\noutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they\nwould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet\nwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would\ncompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.\n(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim\nprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity\ncan be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure\nis to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet\nmanufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point\nto consider when purchasing a lid.\n\n--\nKen Franklin \tThey say there's a heaven for people who wait\nAMA     \tAnd some say it's better but I say it ain't\nGWRRA           I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints\nDoD #0126       The sinners are lots more fun, Y'know only the good die young",

I don't\nhave my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n\n1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \nto cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \nignorant to know I need to buy)\n\n2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?

The point of formal training \nmust be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion\nto know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike \nin a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.\nCountersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among \nnew bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the \nmotorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the\ndirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.\nI have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she\nis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the \nmotorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right \nhandle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries\nto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.\n\nThe main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency \nsituations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of\ncountersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\n-- \nstaal@idt.unit.no",

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.",

I don't know how much\nthe teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the\ntuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way,\nand I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course.\nI could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only\nstarted using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed\n(off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been.\nI knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew\n*that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later\nin my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to\nbring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first\nlesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry\nabout proper handlebar technique.\n\n>countersteering.

Sometime during\nthe lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student\nwould take him for a ride.

Assuming that the helmet/\nhead assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in\nthe other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's the\nthe liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were\ncracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area.

Figure.\n>John Stafford \n\n  Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS\nthat was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power\nburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also\nhad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a \nbit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the\ntime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear\nin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was \nNO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of \"slip\" device in the shaft\nto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!\n\n  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane\ndo a \"stoppy\"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike \nup about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these\nactivities anymore (now that I'm an \"old guy\" with kids of my own) but\nit looked damn impressive!!\n\n  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed\nin that direction! :-)\n\nCheers, \nB**2",

Was\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\n\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz's famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\=@=/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    /\\\n                   /()\\   <-lobe\n                  / XX \\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems ->   / \\  / \\    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  <---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\nhistorians discount this story.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.\n                                                                                                          \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+",

I then went out shopping for\na new lock for the bicycle.\n\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\n\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\n\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\ndon't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\n\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \ndark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the \nlock mechanism would stand up to an \"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\"\nattack.\n\nFourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to \ndeter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the\nweakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient\nyou can cut cables with fingernail clippers.

        "content": "Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!\n\n BACKGROUND\n ----------\n\n The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions \n devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad \n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\n motosports enthusiasts.\n\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\n\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \n\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\n ---------------------------------\n\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\n\n\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\n (depending on the topic). \n\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\n       list directly.\n \n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\n \n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\n\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\n ----------------------------------\n\n It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\n day.\n\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\n\n\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\n -----------------------\n\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\n\n\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\n (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\n based mail systems). \n\n BOUNCES\n -------\n\n Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce. \n\n OTHER LISTS \n -----------\n\n        Two-strokes:     2strokes@microunity.com\n        Harleys:         harley-request@thinkage.on.ca\n                         or  uunet!watmath!thinkage!harley-request\n        European bikes:  majordomo@onion.rain.com\n                         (in body of message write: subscribe euro-moto)\n\n\n thanks, be seeing you, \n Rich (race list administrator)\n\n rich@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n-- \nStefan Fielding-Isaacs                                415.822.5654 office/fax\ndba Art & Science              \"Books By Design\"      415.599.4876 voice/pager\nAMA/CCS #14\n* currently providing consulting writing services to: Gain Technology, Verity *",

I believe I discussed countersteering a horse\nbefore.\n\nBasically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and\nneck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and\nyou pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse\nby holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the\nhorse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a\nplow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins\nunder his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein\npulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit\n(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).\n\nAre you sorry you asked yet?\n\n---\nEd Green, former Ninjaite |I was drinking last night with a biker,\n  Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM   |and I showed him a picture of you.

Books have been written on that! But in regard to\nAeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.\nIf you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero\ndimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching\nthe 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.\nHaving my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very\nconcerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in\nprotection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I\nthink the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a\ndifference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go\nsomewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)\nyou can just detach and stow the pants. \n\nOne thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for\nmany women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and\npetite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. \n\nAnother recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I\ngot 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not\nreally that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must\nbe). \n\n--\nJonathan E.

Mine lasted many\nyears.  The replacement 30AH battery from BMW was a disaster.  The mechanic\nfrom Comp. Acc. told me that CA would warantee replace the bad one with a\nnew one of the same evil bad batteries and tell the customer if they have\nproblems to bring it back and they'd do it again.  It seems that many of\nthose 30AH batteries were DOA, near-DOA, and always unlikely to be going\nstrong by the end of the warantee period on them.  THere was a big batch of\nbad ones, and they replaced them with -you guessed it - more bad ones.  BMW\nswitched to a 25AH battery that has more cold cranking amps, even if it has\nless total juice.  \n\nI switched to a YUASA that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one\nthird fewer dollars.\n\n\nNeil Kirby      DoD #0783       nak@archie.cbusa.att.com\nAT&T Bell Labs  Columbus OH     USA (614) 860-5304\nIf you think I speak for AT&T you might have more lawyers than sense.",

I kid you not.\n\nThis is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing\nlayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.\nMost helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner\ncompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or\ndelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years\nfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose\nup to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have\na video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.\n\nPuncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and\nother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of\n\"parking your lid\" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the\ncomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly\ndamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.\n--\nJerry Lotto <lotto@lhasa.harvard.edu>         MSFCI, HOGSSC, BCSO, AMA, DoD #18\nChemistry Dept., Harvard Univ.  \"It's my Harley, and I'll ride if I want to...\"",

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\n\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\n\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\n\nThird don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after \ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\nand balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\notherwise not in average shape.\n\nWith care, you should be ok.\n\n>The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for\n>a first time rider. I don't want to race; nor do I want to\n>ride cross country; nor do I want to ride on dirt trails. I'll\n>probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city\n>streets and freeways. The maximum I can spend is about $2500 so\n>I'll be looking at a used bike.\n\nI would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.\nSomething in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If\nyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\n\nPossible models: \nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier \nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.\n\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\n\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know\nthem as well.\n\nFor mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.\n\nHope this helps,\n-David\n(dagibbs@qnx.com)",

        "subject": "ST1100 ride",
        "content": "Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\n-- \n\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \t\t\t\tXyvision Color Systems\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\t\t101 Edgewater Drive\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\t\t\t\tWakefield MA\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\t\t018801285",

Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time\nout too.  You and her need to learn each other's body English.

We'll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan't really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I've picked out.\n\nHere's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and\n\t  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!\n--\nDON'T DRINK SOAP!

We'll be riding some twisty, \n> fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n> \n\n\nAn extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.\n\nOwww.\n\nWell, I hate to be a wet sock, but, well...\n\nI was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started\nriding myelf, and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  The passenger\nseats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't\neven usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my\nback by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the\nreasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had\na BMW. :)\n\nI'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains\nor some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.\n\nThe best advice I'd give a beginning passenger:\n\n- Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort\n  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on \n  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop\n  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.\n\n- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider\n  asks you to :)\n\n- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements\n  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,\n  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.\n\n- Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably\n  consistent shifting style).  Avoid \"helmet bonk.\"  Helmet bonk is \n  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change\n  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It\n  gets old real fast.\n\n- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep\n  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands\n  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,\n  but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.\n\n- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be \n  sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're\n  still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.\n\n- Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or\n  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed \n  for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************",

I purchased it via\nsome mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would\nrun down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car.\nKnowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger.\nBelieve it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and\nenergetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just\nsitting.\n\nEventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun\nwasn't strong enough due to its low angle.\n\nI think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more\nexpensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.\n\nI've never used it on the bike because I have an E-Z Charger on it and\nkeep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.\n\nArnie Skurow",

Hence, any apparent\n>similarity in handling characteristics may, or may *not* be analagous\n>in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling\n>characteristics.\n\nOK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.\n\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\n\nI've        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV\n     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca\n                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada",

(BTW, as of a\ncouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750\nGSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that\nmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-\norder types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily\nby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep \nthem honest about acquiring parts. \n\nFor Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a\nHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.\nDitto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are\nnot as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the \nplastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,\nthen, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it\non a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,\nmore traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.\n\nMike\n-- \nDisclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^?\nexit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save/quit :!QUIT\n^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^# ^E ^X ^I ^T ? help  helpquit ^D  ^d !!\nman help ^C ^c :e! help exit ?Quit ?q CtrlShftDel \"Hey, what does Stop L1A d...\"",

When it runs, it runs well. \n> \nGood point, did not catch this in the original post. The only other things \nwhich come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this.\nThe fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let\nsuppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the\nvacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough\nto open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, \nsince the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, \nand as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. \n\nOne way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side \npanels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the \ncorrect size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output\nside of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make\nsure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum \nto the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check \nfor air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is\na vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it \nflows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in \nthe vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog \nor partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced \nto fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control\nhose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.\n\nNow if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there \nis something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, \nI would be typing all day to list them all! \n\nHere are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve\nand open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the\nairbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are\nquite a few on each carb.\n\nI hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American\nHonda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and\ncall the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE. It is a 800 number, but I don't recall\nit off the top of my head. I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days\nlater a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked\nthe support I received, here would be your chance to tell them what you think!\n\nBuy the service manual on the F2, it is an invaluable source of information\nfor working on your bike and I might add, trouble shooting!",

Keep the bike in\n1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for\nengaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.\n\nWhen the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side\nof the car in front of you.

I usually rig the cable\nlocks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or\nthe cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off.

Suggestions?\n\nGlad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding for\nabout two years, but here are my rules for traffic light survival:\n\n     - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have\n       to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the\n       car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I\n       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my\n       visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your\n       taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright\n       white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)\n\n     - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually\n       about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give\n       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.\n\n     - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors\n       *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see\n       any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out\n       of the way *now!*\n\n     - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line, I\n       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from\n       behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-).\n       I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice\n       that there's something in the lane ahead of him.\n\nNow, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line\nthat I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line, your forward escape\nroute is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that\nyou don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line\n(although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up \nnext to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decided\nthat hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.\nAny other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind\nyou?\n\n-rob.\n\n--\nRob Griffiths  | Erasure.ShonaLaing.WildSwans.B52s.U2.JudyBats.REM.Smiths\nrobg@apple.com |  FAA Certified cloud basher  I wanna drive the Zamboni!",

This doesn't bother me when\nriding, but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. Last summer I took the\nbike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned\nthat it should be an easy job. All I would have to do is to remove the\nfront sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find\nthere. Well, upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange\naxle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. It seems that, in\naddition to removing the cover, I would have at least to remove the\nsprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.\n\nQuestion : Would removing this small cover from the left side of the\nengine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (Don't know the\nexact term in english, sorry) ?\n\nQuestion : Has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some\nother purpose ?

Even a normal upshift causes your\npassenger to bob, so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the\nclutch to eliminate this.  It's more work, but your passenger will\nappreciate it!  Also, I've found that using more rear brake than normal\nhelps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops, which\nmakes it much easier for the passenger to hang on.

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,\nnot to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.\nThe non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.\n\nI personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.\nThe first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.\nThis has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I\ncontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\n\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\nto my use and flamage in general.\n\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may\nbe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily\nweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor\napplicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a\nflatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your \nmotorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyone\nwho looks like you, too.\n\n\n-----\nTommy McGuire\nmcguire@cs.utexas.edu\nmcguire@austin.ibm.com\n\n\"...I will append an appropriate disclaimer to outgoing public information,\nidentifying it as personal and as independent of IBM....\"",

Installation would have been very easy, but the seat\nfastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with\nthe stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured that\nout, the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest, though,\ndoes not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the \nbackrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, \nhard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a\na soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.\n\nThe driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable\nenough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat\nwithout a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the \nvolume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it\nseems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit, but I've not \nhas enough time to really test it.  The backrest also comes with a \nsmall pocket.

The dog is no match for a human willing to fight.\nMultiple dogs is a different story . . .\n--\n*******************************************************************************\n* Bill Ranck             (703) 231-9503                     Bill.Ranck@vt.edu *\n* Computing Center, Virginia Polytchnic Inst. & State Univ., Blacksburg, Va.  *\n*******************************************************************************",

Thus, each link is a possible locking point.\n\nAlso, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around\nliquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks \"LOOK\" a lot\nmore effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial\nappearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at-\ncracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally \nfunctional.\n\nFinally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, and\nthe cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the rain\ndressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give\nme a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially\ninflammatory action at stoplights.\n\nI love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur.\n(I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e., on my\nbody) and I can feel the bike already shaking away).\n\nMy first post.

I\nwas told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and\nforce it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and become\nmomentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and\nhave our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's\ndisorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a \nchoke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into\nunconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run like\nthe wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really\npissed.\n\nOOOOOOOpsssss.

        "content": "Hello Folks,\n\nI'm very happy with my \"new\" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...\nthat's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting\nsomething rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much\nanyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a \ntorque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still\n(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe\nI don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion\na little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are \nmy questions:\n\n1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the\nwind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds\n(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my\nvision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece \ndetachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.\n\n2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the\ncrash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming\nout from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so\nthat you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it \nreally picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the \nheadlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators\ndon't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm\nputtering around in the dirt at low RPM?  \n\n3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing\nin the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section\nof the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? \n\n4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline\nwith alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep\nthe engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any \nparticular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?\n\nThanks,\n\n/-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\\\n|                                                                |\n|     DoD# 88888           asphaug@hindmost.lpl.arizona.edu      |\n| '90 Kawi 550 Zephyr               (Erik Asphaug)               |\n|  '86 BMW R80GS                                                 |\n\\-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/",

        "content": "In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap\nthat is going on in the MOA, (which some folks took not as dissemination \nof information that I received, but as my own bad mouthing) I thought that\nI would post this one, which came to me yesterday.  This is from board member\nRobert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse.  This is NOT my words, O.K. guys?\n\n                                   April 4, 1993\n\nre:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement \n\nDear Chick:\n      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the \nMOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the\nOwners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by\nthe by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:\n\n\"Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to\na combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.\n\n    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's\nstatement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with\nthe word \"undertiding\" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement\nof his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a\ngrossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does\nnot just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the \nprocess.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps\nyou intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.\n     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would\nbe most appreciative that when tou call me an \"asshole\" you remind the\nletter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost\nguaranteed to have woeful consequences.\n   With kind regards, I remain,\n                                 Robert Higdon\n\nO.K. MOA'ers, You read it, think for yourself, I trust you do know who\nCecil King is, and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass, and he is\na pres. candidate.  I let you draw your own conclusions.\nRegards,\nCraig Vechorik\nBMW MOA Ambassador #9462\nBMW Vintage Bulletin Tech Editor\nDOD #843\n\"REAL BMW's have TWO Wheels\" <-- politically correct statement",

The stuff seems to work, and it doesn't\nattract grundge like PJ-1 Blue does. I gave it the acid test, a full\nday's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the\nsand dunes. If there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with\nsand at the end of the day, but the chain looked pretty clean.\n\nAs far as mail-order goes, if Chaparral has it in stock (and they can\ntell you if it's in stock, or about how long it will take to back-order\nit if it's not), I usually get it in three days. Competition Accessories\nalways seems to take a week or two to deliver. Motorcycle Accessory\nWarehouse also takes a week or two, and after trying to buy some boots\nfrom them last week, I don't think they actually stock anything. MAW was\nabout $30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots, but on\nMonday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week, so I asked MAW a\ncompletely unreasonable question: \"Do you have them in stock?\" The\nconversation went something like this:\n\nI need to know if you have some boots in stock.\n\n\tDo you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard?\n\nI want to know if you have them in stock.\n\n\tWell, the computer doesn't show anything, I'd have to call the\n\tdistributer to find out if we have them.\n\nSo do you have them or not?\n\n\tDon't you understand what I'm saying? I have to call our\n\tdistributer to find out if we have them in stock or not.\n\nUh, right. So can you do it?\n\n\tYea, call me back in an hour, and ask for Phil.\n\nSo an hour later Phil isn't there, but Mike says he'll check, and call\nhim back in half an hour. Half an hour later Mike isn't there either,\nbut he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month\n(3 weeks away). Screw it, the 30 bucks isn't worth the hassle. I called\nChaparral and asked if they had them in stock:\n\n\tOoh, Alpinestars? Probably not, they are hard to keep in stock,\n\tbut I'll check. What size?\n\nSize 10.\n\n\tLet's see, yes! Size 10, in blue & white, gray & white, black...\n\nI'll take the blacks!\n\nThis was about noon on Monday, they arrived Thursday morning. Once\nagain, three days via UPS ground. I _like_ Chaparral.\n\nI'm not completely down on MAW, they often have lower prices, but be\nprepared to wait.\n\nOh, and if anyone's in the market for sand tires and other ATV stuff,\nScorcher seems like a good outfit, friendly, fast, had the tires I\nwanted in stock, and were cheaper than Chaparral too.\n-- \nBlaine Gardner @ Evans & Sutherland\nbgardner@dsd.es.com",

The \"official line\" in MSF\ncurricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying\nboth brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and\nboth tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to\nprevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more\ntraction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to\nweight shift.\n\nThe \"official line\" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face\nof it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage\nof all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the\navailable braking power by using only the front at time 0.\n\n>>Saying, \"brake until the tire just begins to slide\" is next to useless\n>>advice to a newbie.

I agree that totally locking the front occasionally\nmakes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an\nexperienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like\nCode used to use.\n\n>In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep\n>both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing\n>exactly as *you* suggest!!\n\nTrue, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills\n(which is how this discussion started), \"keep both wheels just on the\npoint of sliding\" is nearly useless information.

        "content": "I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent \nexperience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in London. \n\nI found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot, that\nis, if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on\nhard for braking or acceleration. I tried to always look over the\ninside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible, leaving\nDave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and \nluggage.\n\nHard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit \noff the back is hard to fight. Similarly, I held on to the grab handles\ntightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (I'm\na lot bigger than he is...). Reaching around him and pushing off the \ntank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for \nhim to manage.\n\nOn the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself, I absolutely\nrefuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. That's\nhelmet, jacket, gloves, stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. It's \nnot my responsibility to provide this gear, but it's my responsibility\nto require it if they want to ride.\n\nAnd I agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experience\ncarrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried\nmany passengers before, take a few gentler rides of some duration before\nyou head off to a difficult road like Mines/Mt. Hamilton.

        "content": "My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or\nsomething. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\n\nI eagerly await comment.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He's hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\n                                                                                       \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+",

        "subject": "Guzzi 850-T tires, plus fairing question",
        "content": "I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the\nbottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the\n46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have\nlarge, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get\nthem :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\nwaist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\n\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\nin some way different from us real folks.\n\nAlso, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\nI've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...\n\nAs far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\n\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,\nI still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I\nown.

It\nwas not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was\nheading north from Monticello).  In order to get to the right place, I\nshould clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation\narea.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may\nhave been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is\nabout 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles\noverlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably\nmaintained (I ran it about 70mph).\n\nLooking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on \nthe world.

He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day, and\n_really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a \nsideways Vmax in the corners, and if they passed him going in, he'd\nblow by down the straight (usually wobbling).  Needless to say, since\nhe was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 CB400F, he decided against the Vmax.\n\nToo bad.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nRay Hixon\nWERA #623 Expert\na Single-minded guy",

Hate the bastard who picked the weather for today.\n \n Went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after \nwork, only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the \nride was very zen.\n \n Got up this morning, needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work \non her computers with, rainy as all hell. Soaked and cold by the time I got \nhome.\n \n Since I didn't have another set of thermals which were dry, I said \"to heck \nwith it\" and drove my cage back up.\n \n Lo and Behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm \nyellow thing I haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was 10 minutes \ninto the trip.\n \n And me in my cage. Oh JOY.\n \n \n Happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the \nbike when I first got it, put on an EMGO replacement mirror... hated it the \nentire time that thing was on my bike because I couldn't see a DAMNED thing \nthrough it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you \nget a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur)... And I got a replacement windshield for my \nfairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but \nannoying)... so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing \nthem this afternoon.\n \n 'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ('75 CB360T) is the damned \n\"2 D-Cell Flashlight\" headlight.\n \n Has anyone seen a good source for ~25 watt halogen passing lights? Since \nthe charging system on the CB360T can't handle continuous use of a 50W \nhalogen headlight, I was thinking about putting a couple passing lights \non... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding I do, \nbut wouldn't drain the battery during \"normal use\" (chiefly day trips and \ncommuting to work and back)...",

Do share the details.\n\n\tHOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55\n\nIt's simple.  First, it has to be the first really nice riding day\nof spring.  The bike is back together again, and so are you.  Grab\nall your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premium\nor better.  Head out.\n\n\tIn Ames, there is a road that leads to the little town of\nGilbert.  Gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something.\nHaving just gotten the bike back together, I thought I'd take it\nfor a short ride and check things out.  Heading out of town, I\nwent into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit,\nand started leaning around.  The pace quickened as everything felt\njust right.  Finally, the road straightened and I was ready for a\nbit of speed.  Grab third gear, open her up.  At roughly 90mph\ngrab fourth gear.  Look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail\nto notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twist\nthe throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see\njust how well she's been put back together.\n\n\tAt 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was\nflexing a bit.  Thus, I slowed, pulled off the road, removed my\nhelmet and gloves, unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny\npack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper\npulled in all hot and flustered.\n\n\t\"Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going?\"\n\"Not precisely, no.  I was paying attention to the bike and road,\nnot the instruments.  I just got her back together last night, and\nI'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic.\"\n\t\"My radar says you were at over 145mph.  Care to tell me why\nI shouldn't give you a ticket?\"\n\"Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and\ntraffic, on a strait and flat road, while wearing all the protective\ngear that safety demands?\" (note: I wasn't quite that eloquent)\n\t\"Say, what kind of bike is that, anyway?\"\n<I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750, a Rat Bike>\n\t\"Yeah, I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years.\"\n<compare riding stories>\n<pack toolkit, having tightened that fender>\n\t\"So why were you out here?\"\n\"I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through\nme.  If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone, I'm dead.  If it holds\nup out here, then I know it will work right in traffic.  I do this\nevvery year when I rebuild her.\"\n\t\"Not any more.  You'll find a better place than *my* highway\nto do those speeds.  If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highway\nagain I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can.  Now get\nout of my sight before I write you a ticket.\"\n\"Yes, officer.\"\n\t\"And kid, keep your eyes open out there...\" <drives off>\n\n\tAnd that, in a nut-shell, is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55.\nI don't guarantee that it will work for you, but it worked for me.\n\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

I'll tell you \nwhat we've found and the systems we've worked out.\n\n- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the rider\nto judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something\nand leaning forward.  Remember this.\n\n- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally \nthis means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned\nover and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.\nMuch balance is lost and this can be dangerous.\n\n- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough \nfor the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding \nonto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fast\nbecause braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which \nshoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.\n\n- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not \nout wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.\n\n- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.\nNormally this means \"slow down, and do it now!\".  \n\n\n> turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional\n> signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???\n\nWe only have a couple signals.  \"Slow down\" is her either tapping me on \nthe back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency\nof the matter :-)\n\n\"Turn here\" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is\nalso the sign for \"cool!  Look at that.\"  \"I hafta pee\" is the same sign\nas \"turn here\".  \"I'm hungry\" is the same sign.  \"Go faster\" is usually\ndone by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see \"slow\ndown\" more often than \"go faster\".\n \n> I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that\n> she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...\n\nThe best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and \npillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're \nin almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because\nyou as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely\nfeel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes\nat any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  \nPillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.\n\nAlso, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up\nthan by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and\n\"in the Zen of the moment\" less.

Are there traditional\n\n1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer\nsetting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves.\n\n2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are:\n\na) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP\nsign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the\npegs until you tell her to get off the bike.\n\nb) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough\nthat she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And\n(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as\npossible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your\nballs up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.\n\nc) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't\nlean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.\nDon't look over your shoulder.*\n\n3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That\nmeans don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than\nusual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have\nthe equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,\nso be prepared for that.\n\n4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't\nhave to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.\n\n5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things\nof interest.

        "content": "Okay DoD'ers, here's a goddamn mystery for ya !\n\nToday I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there\nwas a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension\nto compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very\ntangible \"thunk\".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. \nMy bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such\nthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the\nlower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \"bank-follower\", or a\nlittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a\n100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7\nmm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the\nmystery.\n\nThe stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm\nfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of\nthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in\nthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something\nhaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  \n\nOkay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you\nrip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without\ndamaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo\nthat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly\nchanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid\n?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, life\ngoes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.\n\nBarry Manor DoD# 620 confused accidental peg-scraper",

I found I was overdoing\nit (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after\nspreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not\nthe usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so\nthey were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the\nadjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right\namount of Zipper Squish (TM).\n\n>Result: I now know that noplace in Spokane will even _consider_ trying\n>to repair a broken zipper-closer-thingy, which must be a $0.30 part\n>which needs a $20 tool to install.\n\nI've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the\nAccessory Ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of\ncharge.

In fact, if we riders\nneed friends, it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from \nLynn's description, especially if the same crowd gets invited back\nto party some more year after year.\n\n> Sure you didn't rape and pillage-- It's a relief to know that you were\n> such gentlemen-- but because you were not completely out-of-hand you \n> justify your lesser indescretions?

If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the\n\"indiscretions\" and the partyers aren't either, maybe the \"indiscretions\"\ndon't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless \ngood-natured rowdiness among consenting adults.  The only thing that \nreally bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans \nin the street, but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they \nhelped set up the party in the first place.  If I lived there and the\nbikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation\nand good intentions, I'd certainly rather they stick around and party\nthan go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed.\n\n> Oh-- I'm sorry, I just noticed that you left mucho bucks (as in MONEY)...\n> Nevermind my criticism, I was out of line.

It will also remove all the traffic film and stuff that\nyou probably don't realise is there, and give your paintwork its original\nlustre and shine.

        "content": "Yesterday, a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle\ndealer. It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myself\nhave never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience\nof that visit and of an observation of \"SQUILDLY\" behavior by other \ncustomers and/or sales personel:\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nI ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into \"cruiser\" type bikes. My\nfriend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He\nwanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer\nthat sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. \n\nThe place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few \nIntruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.\n\nWell the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I \nmoseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.\nI could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40),\nbut I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured\nto each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs\nfirmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the \"hormone gang\"\ntalking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big\ndeal.\n\nHere is the part that concerned me. The \"HG\" and those shop personel that were\nnot busy with customers went back out, where said \"HG\" members fired up their\nrides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,\none decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.\n\nSQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager\nnot only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they\nwere betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely\nas he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her\n\"pilot\" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers\ncould be heard as well as felt.\n\nI felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those\nin cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and\ndamning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little\nuncomfortable and we left. \n\nI will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my\nanger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open\nmind and doesn't associate me with them. \n\nBTW, I can't afford a new bike.....",

At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much if\nat all.  The alternators put out sufficient wattage, it just that you need\nto be at 4K RPM to get it.  \n\n>3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing\n>in the morning.

Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the\nthrottle.  It should fire.  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle.\nMy R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle.\n\nIt's an EXPERIENCE thing.  Like Zen, it's hard to describe.  It can be hard\nto learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success\nand failure.  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the\nbattery while trying to get it to run.\n\nIf my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while to\nstart.  If it doesn't, I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to\nvaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off.  I've got dual\nplugs which make it easier to start.\n\n>4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline\n>with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep\n>the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any \n>particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?\n\nThe BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit.  It's good for a few MPG and the\nparts are alcohol proof.  The parts it replaces aren't alcohol proof.  As\nlong as the bike isn't going to sit for long periods of time, gasohol is\nnice since it helps keep ping away.  If your bike doesn't ping on cheap gas\nyou ought to raise the compression! (Half a smiley, the BMW twins of the\n80s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the EPA happy.  Dual plugs\nand higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance).\n\nNeil Kirby      DoD #0783       nak@archie.cbusa.att.com\nAT&T Bell Labs  Columbus OH     USA (614) 860-5304\nIf you think I speak for AT&T you might have more lawyers than sense.",

He kicked the dog a \ncouple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dog\nangrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then started\nafter yours truly. At the time, I had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell)\nand as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike, I\npulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of\nthe pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell)\nand he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either. \n\nMy second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. I wasn't paying \nvery close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the\ncarcass. I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I \njust held onto the handlebars and freaked out. Both wheels went squarely over\nthe dog's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4\nlumber. The bike didn't lose any stability at all and I kept on going.

I don't see many people using slip-on's\n>but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive.\n>\n>Thanks!\n>Dave\n>\n\nCost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most \ninstances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more \nperformance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.\nThe mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at \n2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of \nthe slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose\nto but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...\nAnyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,\nwhich is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario \nslip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full \nthrottle.\n\nJust remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or\nexhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may\nhave to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust\nsystem, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point\nwhich re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping\nprofile.\n\nTalk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if\nthey have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the\nsystem also to see what they think about there slip on.\n\nAlso, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on a\ngroup of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a \nside bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at\nthe rear wheel, 85 verses 91. \n\nBuyer beware, of outrageous claimed increases in horse power!

Short side trips to Kolob\n(between Cedar City and Hurricane) and Pipe Springs (on the way from\nHurricane to the Grand Canyon) may be interesting--they are right\noff the highway.  Pipe Springs (a small fort) gives you real insight\ninto just how the pioneers lived.  You have missed one major must\nsee attraction--Cedar Breaks in the mountains above cedar city.\nTake lots of film--they have a reason for calling this kodachrome\ncountry.  Natural Bridges in the four corners area is also very\nscenic, but may be too far off your route.  Monument valley is\nspectacular, but again may be too far away.\n\nRich Tweedie",

At that instance, I would\nof given any amount of money for a new tire.  I'm lucky to be here.\n\n\tJerry",
