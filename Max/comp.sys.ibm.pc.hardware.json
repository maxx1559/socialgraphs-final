I've also read about\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \"maps\" the other\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \"cd\" to these\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\nIt's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \n\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\n\n  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it\nwas me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn\n\n\n-- \nJohn Gayman, WA3WBU \nUUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john\nPacket: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH",

It should be the only non-smt chip on\nthe board.  Slightly below center, and left.

Those are\nwhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have\nthe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:\n\n              5 + +    open\n              6 + +    open             \n              7 + +    open        \n              8 + +    open\n              4 + +    closed\n              3 + +    closed\n              2 + +    open\n              1 + +    open\n\n    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.\nTop to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8\nselect the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the\nsecond drive (drive 1).   \n\n      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have\nto look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.\n\n>2.)\tAre the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?\n\n      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not\nright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables\nare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it\nto the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   \n     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few\ntimes and banged my head for a day.....\n\n>3.)\tIs my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?\n\n     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way\nto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:\n       \n        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)\n   \n    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.\n\n>Keith Rice\n\n      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.

It supports 2 RLL \n          drives with up to 16 heads and 1024 cylinders.  Built-in ROM \n          BIOS supports non-standard drive types, virtual drive \n          formatting, bad track formatting and dynamic formatting.\n          \n          NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS \n          contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.  \n          When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will \n          not \"boot.\"  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips \n          must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital  \n          XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 \n          or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT \n          controller you are using).\n          \n                                       -2-\n\n\n          \n          NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, \n          WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in \n          Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or \n          \"A\" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) \n          instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or \n          the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the \n          etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then \n          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the \n          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 \n          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION \n          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY \n          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the \n          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must \n          be soldered to jumper position W-27.

I can tell you that mixing them \nbetween 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless \nthey are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one \nbank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that \nthe SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent \nconfiguration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit \nnibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte \n).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent \nbecause of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM \ninterface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry \nif too techie for ya].\n\n\nMG>> \tSimilarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to \ngi\nMG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports\nMG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my\nMG>> 16MB ??\n\nThat sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit \nwide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  \nSimple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit \nCPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data \nfrom memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when \nit asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard \nlinks 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in \nthis simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means \nthat a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you \nhave a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide \ndata, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks \nare 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data \nwith 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by \none SIMM at a time.\n\nHope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your \nquestion was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'\n\n-rdd    \n\n---\n . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM,\nit is only \"relatively\" recent that the Windows drivers for this card\nhave evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are\nSTILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,\nmis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.\nIf there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would\ndrop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their\nBBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother\nnotifying me of fixes/releases.\n\nDiamond was helpful when I finally reached the \"right\" person in curing\nsome of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting\naddresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the\nDiamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep\nexplained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not\nconfirmed the validity of that statement.\n\nWhen I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some\nform of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than\nDiamond.\n\nLance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)\n               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll statements, comments, opinions, etc. herein reflect those of the author\nand shall NOT be misconstrued as those of IBM or anyone else for that matter.",

Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different\n   TSR programs.\n\n2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.\n\n3.

I am currently working\non a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with\nPhoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU\nwith UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and \nTerminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong\nwith the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to\naccess the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C\ncode that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that\nwill be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.\n\nI have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code\nthat I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I\nam doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack\nof knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.\nI wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and\nthen to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received, \nthe LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do\nnothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses\nthe bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt\nint86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 )\nthe parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits )\nand the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).

These systems still have on-board\nvideo and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and\nyou get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of\nthem with 17\" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will\nimmediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and\neither the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.\n\nDo not buy a 486SX sytem.\n\nMy personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When\nyou earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they\nget you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large\nsteps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX\nmodels and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.\n\nGordon",

Of course, I said \"No problem\" and went to work.\nUnfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during \ninstallation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using\nthe old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit \nSeagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted \nwith DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if \nI could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition \nwas intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a\n32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried \nto remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am \nunaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I \nkinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS \ninstallations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for \n\"Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC\")...\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPaul \"Mr. SCSI... NOT!\" Fincke",

No\nmotherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call\nfailing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use\n\"slower\" RAM in a machine.

The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes\nthat did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and\nhad closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.\n\nDid you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?\n\nIf you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of\nthe tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  \nAs you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more \nthan you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in \nthe tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is \nat the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best\nguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second\nmarker?  \n\nAnyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape\nis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The\ntape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where\nthe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the \nlight that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty\nor out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have\na problem detecting the end of the tape.\n\nIf the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either\nthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open\nthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head\nassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may\nneed to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor\nis out. \n\nIf it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for\nrepair.\n\n\n---\nScott Hiles\nwhiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil\n\nStandard disclaimer:\n  The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily \n  reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

I have seen some being sold used for about  \n$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  \ndo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  \nISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  \nprobably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  \nappreciated.\n\n-Eric\n\nebosco@us.oracle.com",

Again from my Mac & IBM info\nsheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the\ninfo-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some \n specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller \n specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a\n SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2\n which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and\n reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between\n SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.\n\nIBM\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:\n[...]\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.\n\nSo at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES \nthe through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode\nit blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.\nThe problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put\nrates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT\nthe interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the\nSCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling\nprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which\nin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its\ncost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the\nRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt\nthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\n\nSCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while\nIDE itself limits the through put.",

A note to add is that there is no exact\nconfiguration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a\nsetting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).\nThere are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are\nfor setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine\nhad none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the\nback) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.\n\nWhen booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does\nflicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  \nHopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not\nbeing a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I\nwould not even know how to do that.\n\nAny and all help on this is great fully appreciated.

The first attempt failed in the summer\n\tof 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules\n\tstate that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started\n\tafter a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).\n\tThis is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and\n\tcomp.os.os2.bugs.\n\n\tThis document contains:\n\t*  the background showing the need for these proposals\n\t*  the proposed charters for these proposals\n\t*  voting instructions\n\t*  a voting ballot\n\t*  some example ballots\n\t*  the voting rules\n\t*  the voting schedule\n\t*  the Mass Acknowledgement\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\tThe creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2\n\tand emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred\n\ta continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such\n\tas emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and\n\tmuch more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,\n\tallowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.\n\n\tMuch of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and\n\tlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the\n\tnumber of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility\n\twith their hardware increases, as does the questions on the\n\tavailability of drivers for their hardware, installation\n\tprocedures, etc.\n\n\tMultimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows\n\tMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is\n\tincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version\n\t2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).\n\n\tAny non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,\n\tespecially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.\n\tSo far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks\n\t(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or\n\tfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read\n\tcomp.os.os2.misc for details).\n\n\nProposed Charters:\n\n\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for developers of ported software so\n\t\tas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and\n\t\tspur additional development.  The group will also cover\n\t\ttopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,\n\t\tWindows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program\n\t\tportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and\n\t\tso forth.\n\n\t(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tTo keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy\n\t\torthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.\n\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup\n\t\tfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and\n\t\ttechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.\n\n\t(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the\n\t\tavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,\n\t\tinstallation procedures, system requirements, and overall\n\t\tperformance optimization.\n\n\t(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.\n\n\t(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug\n\t\tdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system\n\t\tpatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.\n\n\t\t[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other\n\t\tnewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.beta]\n\n\nHow to Vote:\n\n\tTo cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.\n\tMany newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this\n\tpost.

If you vote more than once, only the most\n\t  recent vote will be counted.\n\n\t* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,\n\t  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.\n\n\t* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings\n\t  will be revealed only after the poll closes.\n\n\t* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will\n\t  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).\n\n\t* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how\n\t  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.\n\t  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is\n\t  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.\n\n\t* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this\n\t  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.\n\n\t* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal\n\t  passes if both of the following formulas are true:\n\t  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes\n\t      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).\n\t  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the\n\t      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).\n\t  In other words, a proposal passes if:\n\t      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)\n\t  where max() returns the highest number given to it.\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n\tThe voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted\n\tby David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).\n\n\tThis third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the\n\tMass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who\n\thave already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you\n\thave not voted yet, vote now!\n\n\tThe voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on\n\tApril 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.\n\tThe voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that\n\tdate.\n\n\nMass Acknowledgement:\n\n\tHere is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots\n\tas of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:\n\n                          bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu\nAiyagari, Sanjay          ska1@crux3.cit.cornell.edu\nAlcorn, Justin

I had a problem for a while after installing my\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \"Buy the memory\nfrom us\" or something like that.)\n\n\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\"\n\n\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're\nbroken.\n\n\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \"less\nbusy\".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\n\n\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\n\nThanks.\ndonyee@athena.mit.edu",

For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is\nreserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel\nport in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an\ninterrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here\nat work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,\na Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which\nnormally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight\nwith a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem\nwas that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon\nas we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after\nseveral days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.\n\n\t\t\t~ Mike  (sprague.wbst311@xerox.com)",

In the Mac {since SCSI is THE\ninteface for any non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used\nfor the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross\ndrive interfacing as fast as the OS, program, CPU, SCSI, and drive can handle \nit{this shows up best in the Quatra line}.\nIn the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well.\nAlso SCSI is NOT just drives but printers, scanners, expandsion cards \n{this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'}, CD-ROM, etc.\nIDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any\nand I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface\n{Make of that what you will}\nSCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE.\nThis alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water.\nRemember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago\n{When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played\nand SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end\ncomputer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI\noff into the statosphere price wise}\nSCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the\nstandard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it\nchoose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined\ninterface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces\n{at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}",

I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than\na year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability\nto adjust the tension of the stick.\n\nI recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and\nno tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. \nI'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works\nquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so\nleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear\nand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or\ndown in features.\n\nFor price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here\ncompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra\n$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson\nto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.\n\nJust another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something\nthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle\nWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,\ndown, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into\na Gravis gamepad.

However, just in case\nsomething went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed\nto get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed\nthat installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when\nyou're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in\nthe section called, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\".\n\n\n* MSDOS configuration:\n\n     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,\nyou'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive\n(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs\nmuch, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section\ncalled, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\", for some ways of speeding your system\nup.\n\n\n* Windows configuration:\n\n     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the\n\"[388Enh]\" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\nI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry\nto SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you\nmight want to try adding some more lines:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\tSystemROMBreakPoint=false\n\tEMMExclude=A000-CFFF\n\n(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The\n\"SystemROMBreakPoint\" entry is used to enable support for memory\nmanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).\n\n\n* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:\n\n     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that\nyour system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's\nprobably because:\n\n     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your\n\tCONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a\n\twinning solution.\n\n     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to\n\tbe seen ....\n\nIf your system is running much slower than before, this is almost\ndefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the\nWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808\n(\"SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS\"), you must use\nSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really\nslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a\nfactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other\nsolutions.\n\n     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you\ndo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even\ndestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.\nWhat you can do is one of the following:\n\n     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my\n\topinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused\n\teither by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in\n\tSmartdrive.\n\n     2. Use a driver that provides \"VDS\" services (\"VDS\" stands for\n\t\"Virtual DMA Services\").  This is a standard, which is supported\n\tby Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like\n\tthe 1542) to work with Windows.\n\n     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following\nsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I\nam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused\nby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following\ndoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is\nstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:\n\n1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\n   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two\n   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your\n   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   (Windows needs the \"/V386\" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into\n   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies\n   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be\n   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's\n   still there).\n\n2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\n   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\n   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\ASPI4DOS.SYS\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high\n   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would\n   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support\n   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine\n   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.\n\n   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would\n   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting\n   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my\n   C:\\WINDOWS\\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes\n   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE\n   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason\n   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.\n\n   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of\n   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.\n\n   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without\n   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider\n   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.\n\n3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is\n   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer\n   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS\n   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not\n   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only\n   three ways to get a copy:\n\n      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver\n\tkit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other\n\tdrivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is\n\taround $75.\n\n      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you\n\tcan supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for\n\taround $30.\n\n      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0\n\tfor MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in\n\tdifferent directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is\n\tincluded; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two\n\thard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy\n\tof ASPI4DOS 3.1.\n\nNote, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with\nWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing\nthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above\nsolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk\naccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the\nparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off\ntiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various\nmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no\nproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal\ntiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers\n(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems\nshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case\nit isn't a hardware problem.\n\n\n***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:\n\n     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a\nfloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory\nSystems Jumbo 250:\n\n1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive\n   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.\n\n2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.\n   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.\n   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so\n   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my\n   1542.)\n\n\n* Tape backups/restores take a long time:\n\n     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may\nhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 \"bus on/off timing\" for best\nresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup\nor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with\nonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the\nAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,\nstart and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the\ntape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective\ntape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).\nThis also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer\nthan necessary.\n\n     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to\ntransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA\nto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs\nto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is\nnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,\nrewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).\nThe default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is\n\"too large\".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be\ntransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the\ntape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec \"hogs\" the memory too\nmuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to\nmemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the\ntape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,\nbecause data is not fed to it quickly enough.\n\n     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The\ndefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.\nThe \"bus on\" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can\nbe done in one of two ways:\n\n* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the \"/n\" option.  For example, I use\n  a \"bus on\" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the\n  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tDEVICE=c:\\aspi4dos.sys /n4\n\n  Note that there is NO space between the \"/n\" and the \"4\".\n\n* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a\n  program called \"SETSCSI.EXE\", which is very difficult to find.  The\n  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to\n  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for\n  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have\n  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to\n  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have\n  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:\n\n\tsetscsi -n:4\n\n  This adjusts the \"bus on\" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running\n  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the\n  factory defaults.\n\n  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use\n  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I\n  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.\n\nDo not lower the \"bus on\" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it\nabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk\nthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4\nmicroseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may\nhave to adjust it downwards a little.\n\n     Once you've lowered the \"bus on\" timing, tape backups and restores\nshould run faster.\n\n     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other\noptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what\nyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by\nstarving memory refresh.\n\n     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless\nthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),\nthis is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple\nof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the\nbus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried\nrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I\nwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a\nconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,\nalthough the docs say that it works with the 1542A?\n\n\n* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:\n\n     This \"problem\" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my\nsystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.\nHowever, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm\nmentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my\n1542.\n\n     Symptoms of this \"problem\", which persists even after cleaning the\ntape head:\n\n1. Backing up to tape encounters \"unusable sector detected\" errors,\n   resulting in an aborted tape backup.\n\n2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.\n\n3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.\n   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (\"Tape backups/restores take a\n   long time\"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,\n   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.\n\n4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other\n   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software\n   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the\n   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.\n\n5. Too many tape read errors.\n\n     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered\nthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I\nupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy\ncontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I\ninitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I\ndecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on\nthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)\nreliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly\nable to find and use the tape drive.\n\n     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.\nOn the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached\nto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the\n1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to\nthe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different\ncontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my\n1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that\nthe problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;\nhowever, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider\ntrying a new floppy controller.\n\n\n***** Sound cards:\n\n     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and\nthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the\nAdaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the\ntape DMA, this \"conflict\" usually manifests itself as a parity error\n(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is\nthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the\nAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a\nparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a\nhardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity\nerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.\n\n     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording\ndigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase\nthe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,\nrecording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).\n\n     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the\nAdaptec's \"bus on\" timing.  See the section on tape drives for\ninformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may\nnot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity\nerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect\nthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the\nspeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also\naffect this.\n\n\n***** Miscellaneous info:\n\n     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much\nof it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not\nverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm\nnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.\n\n* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the \"DB=\"\n  parameter (e.g., \"DB=2\"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.\n  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM\n  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that\n  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM\n  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install\n  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of\n  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a\n  version earlier than 6.00).\n\n  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the \"DB=\" parameter.\n\n* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one\n  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you\n  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is\n  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.\n\n* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and\n  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces\n  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three\n  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following\n  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand\n  information):\n\n     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for\n\tsomething like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,\n\tyou can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact\n\tAdaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains\n\teverything that you need.\n\n     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the\n\tsame people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM\n\tdrivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know\n\tthe list price, but I've seen this package sold for around\n\t$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS\n\tdriver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,\n\tyou may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.\n\n     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been\n\tobsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in\n\tcase someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the\n\tdrivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410\n\tkit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of\n\tMSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in\n\tthe ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin\n\tboards.\n\n* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows\n  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are\n  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how\n  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the\n  following is secondhand information):\n\n     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large\n\tnumber of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers\n\t(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.\n\n     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup\n\tprogram (see the above section on CDROM drives for more\n\tdetails).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but\n\trequires, ASPI4DOS.\n\n* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:\n\n     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.\n     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.\n     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and\n\tCorelSCSI! drivers/programs.\n\n  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:\n\n     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI\n\tdrivers).\n\n* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar\n  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you\n  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used\n  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know\n  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,\n  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:\n\n\tPD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>\n\tASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx\n\tASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10\n\tASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr\n\n  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might\n  have it, if any forum does.\n\n* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are\n  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.\n  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and\n  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work\n  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of\n  BSD Unix).\n\n* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS\n  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked\n  like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I\n  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still\n  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first\n  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version\n  doesn't.\n\n\n\f\nLocal Variables:\nfill-column:\t72\neval:\t\t(auto-fill-mode nil)\nEnd:",

XT drives\nusually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The\ntwo are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be\nable to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be\nable to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I\nthink). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the\nXT.\n-- \nTimothy Hu timhu@ico.isc.com     | The intelligence (or lack of) expressed\nInteractive Systems Corporation  | above does not necessarily reflect\nResource Solutions International | that of anyone else.\nalso:thu@grips0.uwyo.edu",

The fact that it is worse on the right\nside doesn't help matters.\n\nWhat I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections\nare the norm or are most of their monitors perfect?

ALL these SCSI facts have been\nposted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on \nsumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as \nmac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}\n\nPart of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI\nis which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip\nan Apple salesperson said \"it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip\" {Not at a 6MB/s,\n10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra\nuses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see\nSCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven\nin the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH\nFASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.\n\nDon't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on.\nOne reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is \n(Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)).",

Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of\nhandling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser\nMaster Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.\nIt also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower\nresolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product\nuses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent\nPC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation\nprocessed PS.\n\nThe quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for\nthe PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.\n\nWe were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was\naccepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts\nthe image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript\nprocessor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it\nis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also\naccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but\nWindows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is\nresponsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our\ncamera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's\ndemo though).\n\nI don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be\nsurprised if there are several.\n\nGordon Lang",

        "subject": "Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)",
        "content": "I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have\nthe problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\n1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\n\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,\nbut this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my\nwork (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the\nknowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.\n\ngeoff sherwood",

        "content": "Hi Netters!\n\nI'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about\nmy situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:\n\n1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).\n    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both \n    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / \n    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5\" and 5.25\" floppies.\n\n2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).\n\nFrom what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible\nsolutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these \noptions, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees \nany flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking \n(I don't know very much about these beasts):\n\n1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.\n    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?\n    What do the floppies themselves cost?\n\n\n2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a\n    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any\n    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?\n \n\n3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)\n\n\n4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or \n    recommendations for manufacturers?  \n\nI appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will\nsummarize all responses for the net.\n\nThanks,\n\nGeorge\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n  George J.

        "content": "Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,\nI can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been\ntrying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since\nmy machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]\nHe already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number\nbut I can find out.)\n\nAnyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get\none or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both\nat the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -\nnever gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction\nsheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS\ncorrectly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the\nmaster/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't\nknow PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers\nproperly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).\n\nThe only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've\ntried several combinations:\n\ncontroller - master - slave\ncontroller - slave - master\nmaster - controller - slave\n\nNone of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.\n\nAnother possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into\ntwo seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \"C: drive\" and \"D:\ndrive\" setup info rather than \"drive 1\" and \"drive 2\" like most others\nI've seen.  Could this be confusing things?\n\nSo, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some\ninfo for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper\nabout the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one\nof those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so\nit looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!\n\nMany, many thanks in advance!

I like the price of the Genoa 8500, but if it\nlags in performance behind the S3 cards, I'll pay the extra $50 for one \nof them.\n\nAny info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. If I get replies via\nemail, I'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian Oppy  (bjoppy@ucdavis.edu)",

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.\n\nI just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I\nhaven't seen IDE drives cheaper.\n\n: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card\n: (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down\n: in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc\n: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions\n: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to\n: come down in price.\n\nNo, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because\nnobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:\neasily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or\nMac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.\n\n: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented\n: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better\n: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when\n: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.\n\nOn a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for\nexpandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The\nfollowing are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:\n\nA (partial?) list:\n\t1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them \n\tconcurrently.\n\t2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac\n\tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice\n\twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)\n\t3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For\n\tinstance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor\n\t212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will\n\twork no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the\n\ttermination, plug it in, and away it goes.\n\t4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that\n\tthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is\n\tquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:\n\tto d: on a SCSI system.

(at least that's\nhow it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be\nan all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different\nplatforms.\n\nIs there any argument that \nIDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the\ndrive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able\nto deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because\nof a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?\n\n>: Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive\n>: controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do\n>: at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?\n>: What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?\n>\n>No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives\n>at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.\n\nIf data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to\nperform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main\nmemory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE\ncan't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored\nin main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives \nat the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the\nsame time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?\n\n>I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I\n>haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.\n\nA friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245\nmillion bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets\nclose to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few\nhundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?\n\n>No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because\n>nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:\n>easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or\n>Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.\n\nSo you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,\nconsidering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or\ntape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and\nrun DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives\nat the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years\nago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that\nprevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.\n\n>: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented\n>: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better\n>: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when\n>: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.\n>\n>On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.\n\nBut on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you\nget more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have\na single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI\nchoice really give them more performance than IDE?\n\n>But, you bought your PC for\n>expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.\n\nTrue, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option\nis there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.\n\n>\t1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them \n>\tconcurrently.\n\nNo argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the\nbest reason.

A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac\n>\tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice\n>\twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)\n\nWith all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that\nPC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?

I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that\n>\tthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is\n>\tquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:\n>\tto d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very\n>\tnoticable, as many things can be going on at once.\n\nAfter having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,\nI have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor\nhave I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or\nto/from the same drive.\n\n>One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the\n>ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with\n>little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've\n>added to my PC.

Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be \na nice bonus but is not expected.\n\nUltimate goal: have room for Linux et al.\nEx of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount\nthe ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.\n\nI have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,\nor can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, \ndepending on setup/jumpers.\n\nUseful suggestions might be:\n- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD\nis expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).\n- Do I need some driver to make it work?\n- --- \" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?\n- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy?

This is what all this is about.  Do you\n>get more performance for the money.\nOk once again with the SCSI spec list:\nSCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s\n asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s.\nSCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}\n Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1\n so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.\n\nSCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst\n{for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit\n hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1\n devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds}\nSCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst\nSCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n\nOn the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:\n>IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                          \nAgain synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower\n {Range 0-5MB/s}\n>ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)\n\nOne problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by\npeople.  Its PROPER meaning is \"The set of SCSI interfaces composed of\nSCSI-1 AND SCSI-2\"\nLook at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:\n(My comments in {})\n\nPC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 \"Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,\n{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE...\"\n{this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2}\nTo read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:\n{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}\n\"Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the \nspeed of IDE...\"\nor {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}\n\"Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as\nESDI, 20% faster than IDE...\"\n\nNOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.\n\nSCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers \nare VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed\ndegridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}\n\nIf we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking \nabout SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2}\nIT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.",

If you have only one printerport \n( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,\nyou can assign IRQ2, if its free.

The hardware will\nautomagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high\nIRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. \n   I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1\non IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of\nthe interrupts in between. Works just great.\n   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that\ndetails how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the\nhigher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.\n\n  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the \n\nfirst IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response -- \nespecially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no\nproblems.\n\nJustin\n---\njdolske@andy.bgsu.edu",

Either of these make it\npossible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory\nwithout interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move\nthe data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and\nbus mastering.

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk\ninterface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the\ncontroller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main\nmemory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not\ncompatible.\n\nHeck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about\nISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE\ndrives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE\ndid DMA there would be trouble.\n\n(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the\nlast report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it\nwould require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)\n-- \nRichard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.com\nOS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...",

Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that\nthe >=15\" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over\ndistances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore\n*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*\n(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN\nInformation Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and\nprobably only way of having any chance of receiving a \"perfect\" monitor\n(the definition of \"perfect\" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my\ncase quite :).\n\n>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?\n\nI, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard\nmonitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,\nfinally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,\nbut a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying\nconvince me was \"normal\"). The short answer is no, don't accept these\n\"imperfections\" as \"normal\" because for the premium one pays for the\nlarger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and\nif you're persistent, you'll receive it.\n\n>...............................................................\n>:      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             :\n>: Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              :\n>: Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park, NC :\n>...............................................................\n\n\nRegards,\nPaul Yee\nyee@nimios.eng.mcmaster.ca",

It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.\nThere are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and\nthe software.  THAT IS IT.\nLet us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.\n\nSCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}\n asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}\n synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a\n rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}\n\nSCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from\n SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs\n this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers\n AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the \n slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode \n 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous\n mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}\n\nSCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things\n over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the\n machine and the external device.\n Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver\n software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.\n Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.\n\nSCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this\n requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING\n devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY\n expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts\n \n\nAs I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the \ncontroler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to\nonly FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}",

The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.

I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Kevin Harter",

I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just\nbeen released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed\nseveral monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the\nNanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last\nyear.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the\nranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing\ncriteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I\nscored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it\nscored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.\n\nIncidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading\nreviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the\ncriteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product\ntesting was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly\nknow what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently\nfrom Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the\nranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet\nyour needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of\nwhat we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply\nmore closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell\nanything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you\ndon't also understand the scoring.\n\nWayne Rash",

Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware,\nand therefore your machine can't keep up with things.  Ever notice how when\nacessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I \nimagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time,\nand sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.

        "content": "From: system@codewks.nacjack.gen.nz (Wayne McDougall)\n\nFacts:\n=====\n- A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered\ndown for three months.\n- From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive.\n- Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a\n- When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and \npronounced the disk drive unusable.\n\nMy investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides).\nWhen CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.\n\nI use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.\n\nInstall will proceed \"successfully\", but when I try to boot the server, it\nreports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.\n\nInternal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one\ndisk drive (or at least one large single unit). \n\nAttempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready\nerrors.\n\nQuestions:\n=========\nThe software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen\nSFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II\n(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? \n\nSo how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?\n\n1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what\nis causing my serialisation error?\n2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of\nwhich has failed?\n3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not\nbe serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?\n4. What else can cause a serialisation error?\n5. What happens if the keycard fails?\n6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments\nand guides.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nApology:\n=======\nI appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm\ndealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting\nmy net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system\nbefore.

Rowatt)\n\nThey don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use\nIRQ7!.\n     The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes\nme) contains a printer control register which enables the chip\nto transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7,\nthen onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel\nprinter processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore\nno Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip,\nthus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.\n\n     Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not\nroute interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software\nusually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port\nactivity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably\ngetting the sound card slighty confused!.\n\nWindows may be a different story....",

Dos will see many logical drives, much more\nthan 4 (I've had up to 10).  I've often wondered how many SCSI drives you\ncould hang off a ST-01/02.",

Do people forget that the IDE was specifically\ndesigned to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen\nIDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times\nit was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When\nyou run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it\nat 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,\nnone of them run at CPU speed.\n\nThe only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to\na caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to\nget a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.\n\n>because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.\n\nI've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYousuf Khan",

As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to\nCOM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(\n\nThere are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows:\nC1\nC2\nS2\nP2\nP1\nG\n\nThe second bank is labeled \"IRQ\" and has the following labels:\n5C\n5S\n4\n3\n3S\n2C\n2S\n\nI have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first\nserial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer\nport as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the \"G\" enables the game port and\nthe \"S2\" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I\nhave tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success.

AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure: \"Ok, NDD's\njust not being thurough enough, I'll use Spinrite, I heard that works well.\"\nWhat happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!!  \nAHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to\nbe getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted\nagain the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so.\n\nI'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD, and I really\ncan't afford it.\n\nI'm using SMARTDRIVE, and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk access\nthough, I know that can create problems).  The disk is using the second\noption to trick the controller into thinking it's got less then 1024 cyls,\nand everything else selected is standard, maybe I need to use a different\nhead skew or something?  I don't know.\n\nANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM PLEASE TELL ME HOW!!!! HELP!!!!\n-- \nGT: \"Designing tommorow the night before with yesterday's technology.\"",

        "content": "Hi Netters,\n\nAs promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.\nPeople seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\n\nBuddy Christyono\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsummary of replies\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello Buddy,\n\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\n\nHere is my suggestion...\n\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\n\tDOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\n\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\n\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \n\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\n\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\n\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\n\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\n\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\n\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\n\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the \"A\" is better than \"B\" \n\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\n\tI am looking forward to being able to \"LOADHIGH\" the DD sw.  That\n\thas been an annoyance.\n\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\n\teffort to upgrade.\n\nJust my $.02 ...\n\nRegards,\nMark Bagdy\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nBuddy,\n\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\n\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\nsuch).\n\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\nhappy camper.\n\n-Bruce\n-- \n  Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.\nThe only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game\nwas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed\nregion of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. \nThere was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.\n\tCompression performance for the whole disk has held steady \naround 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files \nare compressed image files and some large zip files.  \n\nIf you have any more specific questions let me know.\nDan\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40\nMB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the\nsame product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.  No problems with either\nproduct.\n\n-- \nRon Bjornseth                 bjornset@pogo.den.mmc.com\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n-------------------- END OF MESSAGES --------------------------------------",

We need to\nfix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If\nyou're really interested, though, take a look at the text file\nP9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the\nP9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,\nyou can build up a new monitor definition that has the right\ncombinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy\nof the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT\nfile, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices\nshould show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.\nYou can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of\nthe driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,\ntoo.)\n\n>The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\n>Speedy program.

So I'd take the\nnumbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing\nwith WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the\n8514, as if anyone cared.)

        "content": "Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card\n\nSeveral problems:\n\n1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB\n   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED\n   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K\n   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB\n   VRAM.\n\n2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:\n\n   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an\n      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often\n      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to\n      be.\n\n   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the\n      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you\n      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).\n\n3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development\n   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\n   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the\n   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed\n   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The\n   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.\n\n   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen\n   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter\n   \"R\". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it\n   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.\n\n   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive\n   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with\n   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles\n   the VGA mode.\n   \n   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use\n   another monitor in place of my usual one.\n\nI still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be\nremedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).\n\n---\nswh, 20apr93",

My system only had a IDE cable\n: for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors\n: on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, \n: the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable\n: with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But\n: for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug\n: in the cable to align these.  \n\nMost IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed\ncircuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your\nIDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in\nthe receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle\nis center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide\npositioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:\nlook into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On\nall drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin\nis pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard\nfor the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins\n39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep\nthe pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the\ncable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the\npin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But\nbeware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables\nwith pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors\nthis doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide\nwhich side is pin 1.\n\n: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\n: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\n: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the \"master\" drive\n: and which into the \"Slave\"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...\n\nIt doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives\nare jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you\nshould be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the\ndrive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper\nselects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the \ndocuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,\nthen just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have\none.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like\nyourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't\nhave convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice\nhelp.  Or post the specific question to this group.

Fixed disk\nsectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to\nmemory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is\nquite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the\ncontroller/cpu know how to use the bus).

I say this because the conversion\nseems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than\nan Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they\nwant to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then\nusing it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)\n\n   As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be\nmodified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able\nto use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't\ntried this, but that would be my guess...\n\n\t\t\t\tRobert Anisko\n\t\t\t\tanisko@usdtsg.daytonoh.ncr.com\n\n\n...you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways - it may be cheaper\nto go that route than to do the conversion; besides, with the Falcon and\nbeyond, VGA/SVGA/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go...",

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives \nwhen performing diagnostics.\n   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way \ninterface connector. They have the following functions and are described \nin order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper \ndescribed nearest the 40 way interface connector.\n\nLK2: LED \n     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the\n     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An\n     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with\n     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will\n     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130\n     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.\n\nLK1: Dual Drives\n     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single\n     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,\n     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.\n\nLK4: Master\n     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If\n     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be\n     jumpered in this way.\n\nLK5: IOChRdy\n     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is \n     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher\n     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per\n     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally \n     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per\n     second.\n\n   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)\nmay be jumpered:\n\n     Master, single drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 & LK4 fitted.\n     Master, single drive without LED on interface\tLK4 only fitted.\n     Master, dual drive without LED on interface\tLK4 & LK1 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface\t\tNo jumpers fitted.\n     Master, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 only fitted.\n\n   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to\nreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.\n\n   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way \nconnector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected\nby the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the \ndrive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further\ndetails.\n\n\n\n\n***************************   S E A G A T E   *************************\n\nThere is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM, SCSI, ESDIand IDE) on\nevery Simtel mirror under\n\n/msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip\n\nIt contains info about the following drives:\n\n\t    st1144a\tst138a\t    st274a\tst3283a\nst1057a     st1156a\tst1400a     st280a\tst351ax\nst1090a     st1162a\tst1401a     st3051a\tst9051a\nst1102a     st1186a\tst1480a     st3096a\tst9077a\nst1111a     st1201a\tst157a\t    st3120a\tst9096a\nst1126a     st1239a\tst2274a     st3144a\tst9144a\nst1133a     st125a\tst2383a     st325ax\n\n\n*********************\tT E A C   **************\n\nModel: SD-3105\n\n                Cyls.

The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique\nElectronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.\nThis is a \"physical layer\" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.\nThe analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while\nthe particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or\nI) physical identification scheme (number).\n\nBut to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)\nit is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the\nmanufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a\nreason to ever do that.\n\nIf your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly\nchangable.  But it is strictly software.\n\nGordon Lang",

Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what, when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS), my HD refuse to boot.  \n\nJust my 2 cent.\n\nJim",

This frees the\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\n\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\n\n> \n> Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,\n> but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):\n> \n> \"The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board\n> direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers.\"\n> I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.  \n> So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT\n> HDD controller doesn't!?!?

When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so \nI can't seem to explain why it crashes.\n\nAll it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and\nafter a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables.

I'd opt for the battery change, though.\n\nIt's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is \ncorrupting the CMOS.

You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other \ncontroller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI).\njust set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it.\nThen, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to \nID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you \nhave more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so\non.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it.\nGood Luck!\n\nWilliam",

My system only had a IDE cable\nfor one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors\non it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, \nthe new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable\nwith both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But\nfor the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug\nin the cable to align these.  \nSecondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\nI figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\nthe drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the \"master\" drive\nand which into the \"Slave\"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...",

For some reason, the system refuses to recognize COM4.  For example, if I configure the on-board (motherboard) COM ports for COM1/COM2, everything is fine; if I configure them for COM3/COM4, COM3 works OK, but COM4 is not recoznized.

(Actually I have NO idea, so don't count that last statement.)  What I'm\n: asking is what pins does it use (or what are it's specifications?)  I just want\n: to solder one myself instead of buying one.  I don't even know what port is\n: used.\n: \n: Help me please (at ke_kimmell@vax.cns.muskingum.edu)\n: \n: Kevin\n: \n: p.s.  I'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or\n: Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)\n\nI do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation\nfor ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-\nmodem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't\nreally a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial\nI wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,\nbut you should still check your software!\n\nI will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is\na commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a\nmodem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications\nhardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA\nCommunications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the\nconnector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is\na \"DB-25\" but IBM has set an alternative \"standard\" of DB-9.  The primary\nsignals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).\nThere are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.\nFor example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate\nin communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an\noutput on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that\nit is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)\nsignal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's\nfive signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)\nsignal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used\nto ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok\nvia the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input\nto the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)\nare Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs\nto the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -\na signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection\nto the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.\nDCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the \"connection\" has been established\ni.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh\nthere are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have\nexplained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:\n\nName    DB-9     DB-25\n SG       5        7\n TD       3        2\n RD       2        3\nDTR       4       20\nDSR       6        6\nDCD       1        8\nRTS       7        4\nCTS       8        5\n RI       9       22\n\nNow to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE\nto a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232\nsignal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert\nthe CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these\nsignals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If\nthis is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,\nand crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other\nend, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send\ndata has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just\nsend the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would\ninclude the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the\nsoftware area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-\nware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the\nserial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to\nbe used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-\nLink or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The\nonly thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also\nfairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And\nthat is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for\nflow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the\nDTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the\nDCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast\nto the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by\nasserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can\nsend.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow\ncontrol?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,\none common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no\nwires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF\ncommands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware\nflow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because\nyour data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol\nsignals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract \"escape\"\ncodes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-\nware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to\ndo it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods\nis to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair\ngame.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.\nBut I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with\nall of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,\nI am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control\nthe RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the\nclear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a\ndiffernt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling\nstuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS\nsignal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-\ning it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the\nRTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other\npossible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain\nsignals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would\nmean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting\nthe DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like\nthis.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more\n\"gotcha\" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to\nsee the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the\nDTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but\nthe RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And\nof course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must\npass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,\nif any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not\nspecify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use\nthis one.\n\n    TD  ------  RD\n    RD  ------  TD\n    DTR ------ DSR\n    DSR ------ DTR\n    DCD ------ RTS-\\\n  /-RTS ------ DCD |\n  \\-CTS        CTS-/\n\n\nGordon Lang",

        "content": "Hi:\n\nI need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!\nI want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:  \n\n     -\tEditing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)\n\n     -\tCreating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)\n\n     -\tEditing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under \n\tWindows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel\n\n     -\tUsing the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, \n\ttalking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of\n\tthe images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.\n\nI've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,\nand decided that a \"nice\" system (price/performance) would be:\n\n\t486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram\n\tATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus\n\t15\" monitor, 1280x1024 NI\n\t3Com Etherlink III 16bit\n\tMaxtor 240MB IDE hard drive\n\nHowever, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these\ntogether, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise\nsurprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even\nhave a 50MHz local bus running...\n\nI have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\n486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\nthe non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\nthat I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any \nspeedy help would be appreciated even more!!)\n\n\n\nBTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following \nconfiguration:\n\n\t486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram\n\tATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram\n\t14\" monitor, 1024x768 NI\n\tSMC Ethercard 8 bit\n\tMaxtor 120MB IDE hard drive\n\nWe're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!\n~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or\nbeen uncovered!  \n\nThere doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish\nrunning the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take\na long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).\n\nThere's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive\ndon't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with\nmedium size images.\n\nI have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\nmachine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \non the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\ntransfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \nimages).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\nmake a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice \n(above), for that reason.\n\nAlso, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!\n\nAny information is greatly appreciated.\n\n-----\nRoss Mitchell, Imaging Research Lab, |   rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca\nJohn P. Robarts Research Institute   |\nP.O.

The floppys have their own processor on their controller\nboard which handles all of these commands.\n\nThe difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are\nintelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the\nCPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor\nto transfer their data.\n\n>>Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,\n>>thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.

Most SCSI cards will\nalso DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore\nallowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept\nas dettach/callback.  \n\nCan you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system?\n\n--David Willmore\n\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwillmore@iastate.edu | \"Death before dishonor\" | \"Better dead than greek\" | \nDavid Willmore  | \"Ever noticed how much they look like orchids?

        "content": "In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine\nwithout spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor\non those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them).\n\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with\neither 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing\npower by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions.\nThis chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz\nmachine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz.\nnote: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if\nyou are running Windows.\nOr, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX\non it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you\nwere running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed\nof your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even\nif your original processor runs at a slower speed.\nThere is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX\non it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.\n\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX\nor a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,\nthen you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and\nreplace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for\nboth normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip\ncosts $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the\n25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math\ncoprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the\nOverdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a\n20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally\nand 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is\nrated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.\n\nYou should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that\nadvertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop\naround as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for\na particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.\n\nLawrence Khoo\n\n-- \nkhoo@husc3.harvard.edu       Lawrence Khoo       Computer Consultant\nkhoo@haavelmo.harvard.edu    (617) 496-8992    Econ.

Every vote counts, so make sure you register\nyours if you want these groups to be created.\n\n \nProposed Groups\n---------------\ncomp.publish.cdrom.hardware\ncomp.publish.cdrom.software\ncomp.publish.cdrom.multimedia\n \nStatus\n------\nUnmoderated.\n \n\nVoting Period\n-------------\nFrom: The appearance of this posting\nTo:   23:59 EST, 21 May 1993\n\nHow To Vote\n-----------\nAll votes must be emailed to: manaster@yu1.yu.edu\nor sent as a reply to the originator of this CFV (manaster@yu1.yu.edu). \n\n-To vote, simply copy the example below and delete either the \"Yes\"\nor the \"No\" before each group to register your vote for or against\nthe creation of that group. A line containing \"Yes/No\" as in the\nexample below, will be considered an abstention with respect to\nthat particular group. Note that each group will have its own\nseparate vote count and that you may split your vote for the groups\nor abstain as you will. Please provide your Name and E-mail address\nas shown in the example below.\n\n\t\tEmail your  vote following this\n\t\texample.....\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: Re: Vote on comp.publish.cdrom.*\n\t\nI  vote \"Yes/No\" for the creation of \"comp.publish.cdrom.software\"\nI  vote \"Yes/No\" for the creation of \"comp.publish.cdrom.hardware\"\nI  vote \"Yes/No\" for the creation of \"comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia\"\n\n\t[Last Name], [First Name] [(E-mail Address)]\n\t.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVoting Rules\n------------\n-Only one vote per user (Two different people cannot vote under the\n same user name).\n-Any votes which are received before or after the voting period\n will be discarded.\n-Anyone who wants to change their previous vote may do so by voting\n again.  They must indicate that they have previously voted and are\n changing their mind in a footnote.  A changed vote will discard your\n previous vote.\n-Email messages sent to the above addresses must constitute unambiguous\n and unconditional votes for/against newsgroup creation as proposed.\n Conditional votes will not be accepted.\n-Only votes emailed to the above addresses will be counted; mailed\n replies to this posting will be discarded.\n-In the event that more than one vote is placed by an individual, only\n the first vote will be counted unless it was changed as above.\n-No information will be supplied as to how people are voting until the\n final acknowledgment is made at the end, at which time the full vote\n will be made public.\n\nAmbiguous Votes\n---------------\nAmbiguous votes -- those who do not follow the specified format, or \ndo not make clear the voter's intent, will, where possible,  be \nreturned to their senders for clarification.  Ambiguous votes which \ncannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is \nprovided will be identified in the final vote tally.\n\nEvery Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!!\n\n\nRationale\n---------\nThe rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or\ninvolved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for\nthe discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora\nfor such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither\nof which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the\ngeneral cdrom community with focuses on library, government and\nnetwork usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted \nto publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,\nand ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.\n \nThe reason for the division into three groups is a natural\npartition of interest between the hardware and software topics,\nand between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext\nand multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, \nPhoto CD and other related formats would be included as well. \nTopics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly\nhardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and\nother legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in\nthe purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other\nnonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom\npublishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as\nindex and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom\nsimulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging\nsoftware, data capture software, data clean up, compression,\nencryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that\naids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and\nvideo.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that\nrelates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,\nsuch as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as\ninformation that publishers need to know about the hardware that\nthe intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will\neventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.\n \nNotes\n-----\nThese groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or\nquestions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or\nquestions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.\nRequests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general\ntopics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms\nmounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.\n \nCharter\n-------\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.software, will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n\tIndex and retrieval software\n \n\tAuthoring software\n \n\tScanning and imaging software\n \n\tOCR and OCR cleanup\n \n\tHypertext\n \n\tSGML\n \n\tPremastering and Simulation (cdrom) software\n \n\tCopyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms\n \n\tOther nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.hardware, will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n\tCD-R equipment\n \n\tData capture hardware\n \n\tScanners\n \n\tVideo and audio capture hardware\n \n\tNetworking hardware\n \n\tMidi hardware\n \n\tPhoto CD hardware\n \n\tPublishing systems\n \n\tCDI and DVI hardware\n \n\tCompression and encryption hardware\n \n\tKeyboarding\n \n\tOther hardware publishing topics\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n\tMultimedia authoring software\n \n\tImaging software\n \n\tAudio and Midi software\n \n\tColor control software\n \n\tVideo editing software\n \n\tAudio editing software\n \n\tMultimedia utilities useful for publishers\n \n\tIntegration of text, image, audio and video\n \n\tCompression and encryption of multimedia\n \n\tMultimedia copyright and related legal issues\n \n\tMultimedia databases and hypertext\n \n\tOther multimedia publishing topics\n-- \n\tHenry Manaster          *     EMail: manaster@yu1.yu.edu\n\tBrooklyn, NY            *\n\tDisclaimer: The above is not necessarily MY opinion nor that \n\t\t\t\tof anyone else :-)  ????!",

When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and\nwaits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an\nerror if DSR never becomes true).

TD runs through to RD\nand DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through\nto SG.\n\nI have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it\nwith a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.\nThe advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.\n\nGordon Lang",

Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even\n| have a 50MHz local bus running...\n\n| I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\n| 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\n| the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\n| that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \n\nHaving in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.\nIt has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized\nby the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may\nshare experience on that.)\n\nAlso, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal\ncache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.\nSo my advice is the 66/VLB.\n\n| We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!\n| ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or\n| been uncovered!  \n\n| There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish\n| running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take\n| a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).\n\n| There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive\n| don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with\n| medium size images.\n\nHave You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have\npaging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is\ncached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more\nmemory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).\n\n| I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\n| machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \n| on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\n| transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \n| images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\n| make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice \n| (above), for that reason.\n\nThe bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from\n0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the\nsame results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed\n(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is\nlousy.\n\n| Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!\n\nThe rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come\nout. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only\nsell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB.\n\n| Any information is greatly appreciated.\n\nJust some view, not much figures.\n\n--\nPenio Penev  x7423 (212)327-7423 (w) Internet: penev@venezia.rockefeller.edu\n\nDisclaimer: All oppinions are mine.",

Think *very* carefully.\nUnless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want\nto trade elsewhere.\n\nDespite the fact that they answer the phone, \"Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're\nhaving a GREAT Day!\", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return\na modem that didn't work as I expected it to.\n\nThe details:\n\nI ordered one of their house brand \"Infotel\" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.\nIn reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over\nthe name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not\nhave ordered it, had I known this in advance.\n\nIt arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was\npreconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.\n\nFor several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the\ntime I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.\n\nAlthough the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or\n14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After\nspending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested\ndisabling the COM2 port.\n\nThis appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long\nterm solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both\nwould not be in use at the same time as the modem.\n\nI called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail \nhell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I \nwas then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they \ndidn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.\n\nI called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA\nnumber. She promptly switched me to a \"Tech Support\" rep that implied that\nit was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA\nnumber. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I\nwas not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does\nnot work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more \nthan the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local\ncharitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered\na Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.\n\nFor $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know \nwill support their users and sold by a company (based on personal\nexperience) will treat me right if there is a problem.

I've\nnever taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what\nI've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably\ndoesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure\nif the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier\nmodems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.\n\nagain, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated\nthe Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you\nwant a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find\npeople who HAVE worked with the Sportster.\n\npersonally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd\nbuy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this\nis exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right\nnow.\n\nand now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want\nto get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to\ncomp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll\nget in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you\nmay get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts\ncomplete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to\navoid spreading faulty info).\n\n>The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression.\n\njust as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in\neither CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only\noperate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is\ncurrently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary\nmode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.\n\nand just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also\nsupported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).\n\n>The difference\n>with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. \n\ntake a second look at the original question:\n\n>In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says:\n>>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external\n                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nsee the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST\nmodem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier\nV.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it\ntherefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.\n\nalso, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb\nversion of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are\neven older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.\n\n>This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of\n>the same type unit to achieve this speed.\n\nHST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about\nHST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a\nproprietary modulation scheme.\n\n>The Sportster will do\n>asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way\n>only.\n\nI do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some\nway.....\n\nfirst off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is\npart of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a\nfeature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter\nin the Courier DS manual).\n\nsecond, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an\nasymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed\nin both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,\nand has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed\nchannel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if\nyou're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of\ninfo back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,\na penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse\ndirections.\n\nV.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full\ndata rate in both directions at the same time.\n\nthird, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with\nsymmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.\n\n>The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.\n\nagain, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable\nto whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large\nfootprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an\nupgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which\ncould eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two\nupgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.\n\nlater.....\n   --jim\n\n--\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W\nAMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

        "content": "It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible\n486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:\nAnd also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.\n\nThe 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX\nsocket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.\nthe 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any\nsoftware query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the\ncoproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the\nactual coprocessor.\n\nThe internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit\nrate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance\nboost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a\n386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and\nQAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,\nis about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is\naround the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,\nand DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2\ncompatibility, but I didn't test it.\n\nThe 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually\na small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains\nthe logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX\nPGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board\ndoubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when \naccess to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available\nfrom Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20\nonly.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.\nIf Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need\nto put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...\n\nI also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K\nexternal cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still\nsignificantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.\n\nIMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or\ncan't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,\nbut if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure\nabout the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't\nbeat it in any significant way.\n\nThe last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,\nasking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:\n\nTreasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.\n1-800-677-9781\nThe 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00\n\nBut....\n\nI liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.\nIf you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you\nmore info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,\nSo I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions\nregarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.\n\njamesc\n909-396-0408\n\n\n-- \n=========================================\nIf someone asks if you are a God, you say...

Would speedstor or diskmanager work for this, I used these\nprograms quite a lot in the XT-days, but I don't have these anymore, Seagate\nused to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold.\n \nHelp will be greatly appreciated.\n \nRonald Schalk\nr.schalk@uci.kun.nl",

This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit\nprocessor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s\nPentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions\nper clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola\nis expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two\nconfigurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50\nSPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance\nfor the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89\nperformance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down\nversion of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000\nworkstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip\nwith protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus\nbuilt in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the\nMicro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop\nPowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,\nincluding ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source\nnoted.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has\nbeen extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive\narchitecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million\ntransistors using a 0.6-micron technology.

Normal {asynchronous}\n SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these\n modes is mainly in the software drivers.\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. \n Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for\n a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.\n 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using\n SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which\n results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit\n and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software\n drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI\n interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term\n 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},\n 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit}.\n\n8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 \nthat I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software\ncontrolers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds\nfor SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT\nNEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit\nSCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1\nelectornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider\n16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but\n4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1\nbut is 8-bit SCSI-2.\nRule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.\n\n8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost\ncompared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.",

It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,\nv.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so\nyou can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone\nline.  They will \"fall back\" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even\ndisable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to\nconnect with slower and older modems.\n\nIt has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with\nmulti-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).\n\nThey use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)\nwhich reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and\ncleanest connection possible.\n\nThese modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech\nsupport (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.\n\nThey also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the\nNEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which\nwill let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows\napplication just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of\nany font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax\ngraphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,\nas well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).\n\nI'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or\nbelow the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an\nequivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is\nbacked by a company that will never go away.\n\nThis price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of\ndowntown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home\nto pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal\nmodem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including\ninstallation.)\n\nIf you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem\nat an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for\nabout ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.\n\nIf you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at \n(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.\n\nThe modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.\n\nThanks.  \nPete",

This is best achieved\n   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.\n   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)\n\n3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.\n\nOK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC\nwhich will act as a universal sync decoder.\n\nI want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync\npulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting\nthe -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.\n\nThere are 2 reasons for doing this\n\n1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're\n   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.\n\n2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the\n   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my\n   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,\n   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.\n   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA\n   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,\n   I can get down to 1.\n\nUltimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,\nbut I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...\n\n\n\n--\nAlan Brown\ndogbowl@dogbox.acme.gen.nz",

An update to the chipset may \nbegat an update to the motherboard board design.\n\nWhat I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this\noff as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT \nalong with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple.\nIf I were you I would be cautious about this.\n\nYou might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA\nmotherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are\nVL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real'\n32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive\nthan equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board.\n\nLook in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother-\nboard.

Will there be a noticable\n>     decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate?\n\n     For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers\ngenerally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher\nthroughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk\n($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a\ngood SCSI controller.\n\n     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're\nused with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).\nUnfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking\noperating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is\nmostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to\nconnect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.\nHowever, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.\n\n     If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's\ncheaper, and you'll have less headaches.\n\n> 4)  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my\n>     hard-drive (bernoulli box, CD-rom, Tape Drive, etc).\n\n[ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what\n  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]\n\n     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,\nwhich probably don't exist unless you're using one of the \"better\"/\"high\nperformance\" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI\ncontrollers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and\ndrivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular\nname-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased\n(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:\n\n* Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI\n  controllers.\n\n* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).\n  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card\n  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.\n\n     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape\ndrives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it\nworks only with Adaptec controllers.\n\n> 5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a\n>     SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar\n>     equipment.\n\n     Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a\nhigh-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound\nright, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers,\nyou'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound\ncards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and\nWindows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI\ncontroller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape\nbackups).  If you want a copy of my \"Adaptec 1542 hints and tips\" file,\nsend email.\n\n     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card;\nthe problems are really with the general hardware and software design of\nthe PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card\nis what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.\n\n     SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC\ncompatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows\n3.1, stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'll\nhave to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than\none SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the\npossible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say, \"probably\", because,\nwhile I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this really\nwill be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will, but I don't know\nfor sure.  ]",

My\n>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.\n\nRunning MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the\nfollowing is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified\nexplanation.\n\nTechnically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer\nadapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that\n\"Something's happening here, please take note.\" How the CPU is\nprogrammed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.\nIn MS-DOS, the \"interrupt vector\" is used to store the address of the\nfunction that handles each interrupt.\n\nNow, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready\nto print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When\nDOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,\nwait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to\nthe LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's\nfree for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. \n\nWith any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing\napproach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU\ncycles.) Hence, you can't \"share\" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're\nrunning Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.\n\nAnother issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses\ninterrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what\nto play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is\nrequired to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is\nneeded.\n\nYou can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use\nthem only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine\nis same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came\nfrom. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.\n\nRemember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the\ngeneral picture correctly enough.\n\nCheers,\n\n-- \n               Juha Liukkonen, aka jliukkon@cc.helsinki.fi\n              University of Helsinki,  Dept. of  Lost Souls\n           \"Trust me, I know what I'm doing.\" - Sledge Hammer",

The manual and installation\nprogram recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to\nIRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now\nI have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this \"cascade to\nIRQ8-15\" business?  \n\nA related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that \nonly DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about\n32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus\nextension to do 32-bit DMA?\n\nYet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang\nthe machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode??\nCivilization however works fine ( at least so far).

Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and\nwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller\ncard on my ISA 486-50.\n\nI'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.\nAnd I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)\nabout buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting\nsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this\nnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and\nthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?\nObviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would\nYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?\n\nAlong those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I\nwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?\nAnd how much would it cost?\n\nI actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook\nup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.\nActually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and\nown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a\nSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI\nHD's SCSI-2?\n\nThanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.\n\nRandy",

It can\ndo 1280x1024x256 at 75Hz, 1152x900x256 at 80Hz, 1024x768x256 at 90Hz(!),\n1024x768x65536 at 75Hz.  It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and\n800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth \nmonitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor,\notherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)\n\n  If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you should\ngo to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in the\nvideo sig.

But no problem so far.\n\nWhen I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standard\nRGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc.\n\nPhillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I\nconnected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of.\n\nThe problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines.\nThe display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to\nCGA - but useful for my laptop).\n\nAny of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors?\n\nI've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that\nhe has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer\nis now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said\nsorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway?\nA UK support dealer said \"Circuit diagrams?

(hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable\n   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between\n   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the\n   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it\n   in the high-impedence mode.\n\n - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate\n   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines\n   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't\n   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes\n   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically \n   disconnected by a jumper.\n\n   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold\n   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true\n   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and\n   that certainly isn't a requirement.)\n\n - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the\n   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance\n   reasons.  \n\nAnd the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.\n\nJoe Morris / MITRE  (jcmorris@mitre.org)",

These drives\n: are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb\n: disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the\n: prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently\n: not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to\n: develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there\n: any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?\n\nCertainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a\ncheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP\n200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more\nexpensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.\n\nA couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb\nflopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do\nthey need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy\ndrive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk\nand hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.\n\nOn the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a\nPCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing\noptical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a\nproduct themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format\nis a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is\nidentical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was\nquoted as saying that a 2.5\" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data\nthough he refused to comment on any possibility of this being\nproductized.\n\nThe article said that one of the problems holding back development in\nthis area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2\ndistinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it\nprobably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it\ninto the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it\nprobably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead\nto get MDs accepted.\n\n--\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndavid shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625\n                inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq\n\t\t\"They didn't like the rates, they don't like the poll tax,\n\t\t and they won't like the council tax.\"   - Nicholas Ridley",

This \nwill remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS \nsettings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, \nthere is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of \nshorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts \npower to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is \nsomething like this on your board too. \n\nIn the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on \n\"Setup\" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to \"\nAlways\" unless they know what password you used.

I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.\n\nHowever, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.\n\nIs there anything more I can do to try and save this drive?

My\n>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.\n\nSimple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be\nsome confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use\nthe same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it\nis not possible to have both cards active at the same time.\n\nHere is an example.  For some time, I was short of \"free interrupts.\"  I had a\ntape controller (not a \"floppy tape\") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an\n*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my\nmodem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and\nthe tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt\nhandler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate\nan interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape\ncontroller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would\nmost likely \"hang.\")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it\ninstalls an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for\nthe serial port.\n\nUnder DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the\nstatus of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.\nThat's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.\nTry that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)\n-- \nKenneth R.

COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM\nport, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just\nsearches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The\nfirst equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by\nthe rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set\nof \"standard\" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the\norder in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for\nserial ports.\n\nSo, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were\nthis address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS\nto determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the\nfield in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that\nthere are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly, I don't know of a simgle\nprogram that would actually have a problem with this.)\n\n--\nBob Nichols\nAT&T Bell Laboratories\nrnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com",

        "content": "Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways\nlately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My\nmachine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from\nwhen I called the order in. \n\n   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the \nperipherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I\nwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway \ndocumentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.\nThe Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came\nwith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)\nwas properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and \nhas been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly\neven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a \nlot to do with it. \n\n   It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \"maps\" the other\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \"cd\" to these\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\nIt's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \n\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\n\n  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it\nwas me.

Those are\nwhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have\nthe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:\n\n              5 + +    open\n              6 + +    open             \n              7 + +    open        \n              8 + +    open\n              4 + +    closed\n              3 + +    closed\n              2 + +    open\n              1 + +    open\n\n    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.\nTop to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8\nselect the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the\nsecond drive (drive 1).   \n\n      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have\nto look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.\n\n>2.)\tAre the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?\n\n      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not\nright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables\nare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it\nto the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   \n     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few\ntimes and banged my head for a day.....\n\n>3.)\tIs my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?\n\n     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way\nto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:\n       \n        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)\n   \n    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.\n\n>Keith Rice\n\n      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.

To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or \n          the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the \n          etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then \n          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the \n          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 \n          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION \n          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY \n          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the \n          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must \n          be soldered to jumper position W-27.

I can tell you that mixing them \nbetween 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless \nthey are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one \nbank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that \nthe SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent \nconfiguration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit \nnibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte \n).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent \nbecause of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM \ninterface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry \nif too techie for ya].\n\n\nMG>> \tSimilarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to \ngi\nMG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports\nMG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my\nMG>> 16MB ??\n\nThat sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit \nwide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  \nSimple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit \nCPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data \nfrom memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when \nit asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard \nlinks 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in \nthis simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means \nthat a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you \nhave a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide \ndata, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks \nare 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data \nwith 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by \none SIMM at a time.\n\nHope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your \nquestion was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'\n\n-rdd    \n\n---\n . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

I mean, cache speed is one thing,\nbut all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that\nfaster... \nI'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times \nas fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!\n\nregards, JV\n                                                                /////\nname:    J-V Meuldijk                                          [ o o ]\naddress: gildelaar 4                                            \\_=_/\n         4847 hw teteringen                                     _| |_ \n         holland                  e-mail:  volkert@kub.nl      / \\_/ \\\n_____________________________________________________________oOOO___OOOo__",

If anyone can show me something that I\nam doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack\nof knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.\nI wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and\nthen to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received, \nthe LEDs will indicate this.

These systems still have on-board\nvideo and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and\nyou get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of\nthem with 17\" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will\nimmediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and\neither the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.\n\nDo not buy a 486SX sytem.\n\nMy personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When\nyou earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they\nget you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large\nsteps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX\nmodels and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.\n\nGordon",

The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes\nthat did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and\nhad closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.\n\nDid you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?\n\nIf you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of\nthe tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  \nAs you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more \nthan you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in \nthe tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is \nat the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best\nguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second\nmarker?  \n\nAnyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape\nis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The\ntape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where\nthe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the \nlight that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty\nor out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have\na problem detecting the end of the tape.\n\nIf the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either\nthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open\nthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head\nassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may\nneed to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor\nis out. \n\nIf it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for\nrepair.\n\n\n---\nScott Hiles\nwhiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil\n\nStandard disclaimer:\n  The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily \n  reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

I am thinking  \nof running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  \nthat more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  \ncan see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  \n$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  \nthe entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  \nthe machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  \navoid...\n\nSo my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  \nwell with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  \n$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  \ndo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  \nISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  \nprobably all of this is just wishful thinking...

Again from my Mac & IBM info\nsheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the\ninfo-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some \n specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller \n specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a\n SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2\n which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and\n reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between\n SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.\n\nIBM\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:\n[...]\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.\n\nSo at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES \nthe through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode\nit blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.\nThe problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put\nrates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT\nthe interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the\nSCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling\nprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which\nin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its\ncost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the\nRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt\nthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\n\nSCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while\nIDE itself limits the through put.",

There's apparently at least two jumpers\non the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I\nhave located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like\nto know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they \nare located.\n\nProblem 2:\nMy hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe)\nI get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have been\nformatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating\nsystem on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting\nthe MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible\nmemory drivers.\nAre there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?\n\n\tThanks in advance\n\n        Jouni\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nJouni Marttila - Yo-kyl{ 11 B 25,  20540 Turku,  FINLAND - +358 21 374624____\njmarttila@abo.fi - jmarttila@finabo - abovax::jmarttila - jjmartti@utu.fi__\nPGP-key available via finger jmarttila@abo.fi ___________________________",

        "content": "* Attention voters:\n*\n* I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting.\n* Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV.\n* If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again.\n* (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day)\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\n\tThis is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation\n\tof four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:\n\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)\n\t(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to\n\t     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)\n\t(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)\n\t(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)\n\t(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)\n\n\tThis is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting\n\tand comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to\n\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer\n\tof 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules\n\tstate that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started\n\tafter a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).\n\tThis is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and\n\tcomp.os.os2.bugs.\n\n\tThis document contains:\n\t*  the background showing the need for these proposals\n\t*  the proposed charters for these proposals\n\t*  voting instructions\n\t*  a voting ballot\n\t*  some example ballots\n\t*  the voting rules\n\t*  the voting schedule\n\t*  the Mass Acknowledgement\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\tThe creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2\n\tand emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred\n\ta continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such\n\tas emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and\n\tmuch more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,\n\tallowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.\n\n\tMuch of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and\n\tlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the\n\tnumber of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility\n\twith their hardware increases, as does the questions on the\n\tavailability of drivers for their hardware, installation\n\tprocedures, etc.\n\n\tMultimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows\n\tMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is\n\tincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version\n\t2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).\n\n\tAny non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,\n\tespecially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.\n\tSo far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks\n\t(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or\n\tfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read\n\tcomp.os.os2.misc for details).\n\n\nProposed Charters:\n\n\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for developers of ported software so\n\t\tas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and\n\t\tspur additional development.  The group will also cover\n\t\ttopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,\n\t\tWindows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program\n\t\tportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and\n\t\tso forth.\n\n\t(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tTo keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy\n\t\torthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.\n\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup\n\t\tfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and\n\t\ttechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.\n\n\t(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the\n\t\tavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,\n\t\tinstallation procedures, system requirements, and overall\n\t\tperformance optimization.\n\n\t(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.\n\n\t(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug\n\t\tdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system\n\t\tpatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.\n\n\t\t[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other\n\t\tnewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.beta]\n\n\nHow to Vote:\n\n\tTo cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.\n\tMany newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this\n\tpost.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of\n\tthis post.\n\n\t1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:\n\n\t    If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \"yes\" after its name.\n\t    If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \"no\" after its name.\n\t    To abstain, leave a blank after its name.\n\n\t2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and\n\t    your first name (i.e. your personal name).\n\n\t3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the\n\t    ballot.\n\n\t4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm\n\t    (Central Time), April 24, 1993.\n\n\nBallot:\n\n----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----\n\n        (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:\n        (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:\n        (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:\n        (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n        (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:\n\n        (f)       voter's last, first name:\n\n        e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24\n\n----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------\n\n\nExample Ballot #1:\n\n\t(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n\t(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n\t(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no\n\t(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n\t(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no\n\n\t(f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John\n\n\tIn this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting\n\tto be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to\n\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of\n\tcomp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view\n\ton the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. \n\n\nExample Ballot #2:\n\n\t(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n\t(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n\t(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes\n\t(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes\n\t(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes\n\n\t(f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane\n\n\tIn this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all\n\tthe proposals.\n\n\nVoting Rules:\n\n\t* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most\n\t  recent vote will be counted.\n\n\t* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,\n\t  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.\n\n\t* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings\n\t  will be revealed only after the poll closes.\n\n\t* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will\n\t  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).\n\n\t* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how\n\t  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.\n\t  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is\n\t  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.\n\n\t* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this\n\t  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.\n\n\t* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal\n\t  passes if both of the following formulas are true:\n\t  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes\n\t      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).\n\t  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the\n\t      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).\n\t  In other words, a proposal passes if:\n\t      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)\n\t  where max() returns the highest number given to it.\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n\tThe voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted\n\tby David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).\n\n\tThis third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the\n\tMass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who\n\thave already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you\n\thave not voted yet, vote now!\n\n\tThe voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on\n\tApril 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.\n\tThe voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that\n\tdate.\n\n\nMass Acknowledgement:\n\n\tHere is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots\n\tas of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:\n\n                          bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu\nAiyagari, Sanjay          ska1@crux3.cit.cornell.edu\nAlcorn, Justin

I had a problem for a while after installing my\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \"Buy the memory\nfrom us\" or something like that.)\n\n\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\"\n\n\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're\nbroken.\n\n\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \"less\nbusy\".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\n\n\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\n\nThanks.\ndonyee@athena.mit.edu",

For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is\nreserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel\nport in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an\ninterrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here\nat work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,\na Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which\nnormally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight\nwith a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem\nwas that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon\nas we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after\nseveral days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.\n\n\t\t\t~ Mike  (sprague.wbst311@xerox.com)",

In the Mac {since SCSI is THE\ninteface for any non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used\nfor the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross\ndrive interfacing as fast as the OS, program, CPU, SCSI, and drive can handle \nit{this shows up best in the Quatra line}.\nIn the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well.\nAlso SCSI is NOT just drives but printers, scanners, expandsion cards \n{this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'}, CD-ROM, etc.\nIDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any\nand I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface\n{Make of that what you will}\nSCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE.\nThis alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water.\nRemember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago\n{When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played\nand SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end\ncomputer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI\noff into the statosphere price wise}\nSCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the\nstandard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it\nchoose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined\ninterface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces\n{at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}",

I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than\na year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability\nto adjust the tension of the stick.\n\nI recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and\nno tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. \nI'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works\nquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so\nleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear\nand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or\ndown in features.\n\nFor price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here\ncompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra\n$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson\nto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.\n\nJust another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something\nthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle\nWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,\ndown, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into\na Gravis gamepad.

However, just in case\nsomething went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed\nto get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed\nthat installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when\nyou're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in\nthe section called, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\".\n\n\n* MSDOS configuration:\n\n     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,\nyou'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive\n(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs\nmuch, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section\ncalled, \"Windows 3.1 runs slowly\", for some ways of speeding your system\nup.\n\n\n* Windows configuration:\n\n     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the\n\"[388Enh]\" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\nI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry\nto SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you\nmight want to try adding some more lines:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\tSystemROMBreakPoint=false\n\tEMMExclude=A000-CFFF\n\n(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The\n\"SystemROMBreakPoint\" entry is used to enable support for memory\nmanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).\n\n\n* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:\n\n     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that\nyour system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's\nprobably because:\n\n     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your\n\tCONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a\n\twinning solution.\n\n     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to\n\tbe seen ....\n\nIf your system is running much slower than before, this is almost\ndefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the\nWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808\n(\"SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS\"), you must use\nSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really\nslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a\nfactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other\nsolutions.\n\n     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you\ndo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even\ndestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.\nWhat you can do is one of the following:\n\n     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my\n\topinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused\n\teither by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in\n\tSmartdrive.\n\n     2. Use a driver that provides \"VDS\" services (\"VDS\" stands for\n\t\"Virtual DMA Services\").  This is a standard, which is supported\n\tby Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like\n\tthe 1542) to work with Windows.\n\n     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following\nsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I\nam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused\nby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following\ndoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is\nstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:\n\n1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\n   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two\n   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your\n   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   (Windows needs the \"/V386\" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into\n   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies\n   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be\n   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's\n   still there).\n\n2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\n   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\n   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\ASPI4DOS.SYS\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high\n   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would\n   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support\n   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine\n   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.\n\n   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would\n   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting\n   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my\n   C:\\WINDOWS\\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes\n   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE\n   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason\n   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.\n\n   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of\n   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.\n\n   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without\n   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider\n   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.\n\n3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is\n   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer\n   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS\n   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not\n   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only\n   three ways to get a copy:\n\n      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver\n\tkit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other\n\tdrivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is\n\taround $75.\n\n      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you\n\tcan supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for\n\taround $30.\n\n      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0\n\tfor MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in\n\tdifferent directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is\n\tincluded; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two\n\thard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy\n\tof ASPI4DOS 3.1.\n\nNote, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with\nWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing\nthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above\nsolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk\naccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the\nparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off\ntiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various\nmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no\nproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal\ntiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers\n(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems\nshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case\nit isn't a hardware problem.\n\n\n***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:\n\n     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a\nfloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory\nSystems Jumbo 250:\n\n1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive\n   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.\n\n2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.\n   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.\n   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so\n   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my\n   1542.)\n\n\n* Tape backups/restores take a long time:\n\n     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may\nhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 \"bus on/off timing\" for best\nresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup\nor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with\nonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the\nAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,\nstart and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the\ntape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective\ntape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).\nThis also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer\nthan necessary.\n\n     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to\ntransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA\nto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs\nto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is\nnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,\nrewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).\nThe default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is\n\"too large\".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be\ntransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the\ntape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec \"hogs\" the memory too\nmuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to\nmemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the\ntape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,\nbecause data is not fed to it quickly enough.\n\n     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The\ndefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.\nThe \"bus on\" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can\nbe done in one of two ways:\n\n* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the \"/n\" option.  For example, I use\n  a \"bus on\" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the\n  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tDEVICE=c:\\aspi4dos.sys /n4\n\n  Note that there is NO space between the \"/n\" and the \"4\".\n\n* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a\n  program called \"SETSCSI.EXE\", which is very difficult to find.  The\n  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to\n  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for\n  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have\n  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to\n  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have\n  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:\n\n\tsetscsi -n:4\n\n  This adjusts the \"bus on\" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running\n  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the\n  factory defaults.\n\n  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use\n  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I\n  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.\n\nDo not lower the \"bus on\" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it\nabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk\nthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4\nmicroseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may\nhave to adjust it downwards a little.\n\n     Once you've lowered the \"bus on\" timing, tape backups and restores\nshould run faster.\n\n     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other\noptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what\nyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by\nstarving memory refresh.\n\n     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless\nthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),\nthis is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple\nof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the\nbus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried\nrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I\nwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a\nconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,\nalthough the docs say that it works with the 1542A?\n\n\n* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:\n\n     This \"problem\" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my\nsystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.\nHowever, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm\nmentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my\n1542.\n\n     Symptoms of this \"problem\", which persists even after cleaning the\ntape head:\n\n1. Backing up to tape encounters \"unusable sector detected\" errors,\n   resulting in an aborted tape backup.\n\n2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.\n\n3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.\n   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (\"Tape backups/restores take a\n   long time\"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,\n   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.\n\n4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other\n   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software\n   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the\n   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.\n\n5. Too many tape read errors.\n\n     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered\nthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I\nupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy\ncontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I\ninitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I\ndecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on\nthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)\nreliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly\nable to find and use the tape drive.\n\n     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.\nOn the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached\nto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the\n1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to\nthe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different\ncontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my\n1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that\nthe problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;\nhowever, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider\ntrying a new floppy controller.\n\n\n***** Sound cards:\n\n     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and\nthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the\nAdaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the\ntape DMA, this \"conflict\" usually manifests itself as a parity error\n(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is\nthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the\nAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a\nparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a\nhardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity\nerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.\n\n     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording\ndigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase\nthe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,\nrecording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).\n\n     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the\nAdaptec's \"bus on\" timing.  See the section on tape drives for\ninformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may\nnot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity\nerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect\nthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the\nspeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also\naffect this.\n\n\n***** Miscellaneous info:\n\n     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much\nof it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not\nverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm\nnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.\n\n* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the \"DB=\"\n  parameter (e.g., \"DB=2\"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.\n  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM\n  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that\n  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM\n  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install\n  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of\n  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a\n  version earlier than 6.00).\n\n  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the \"DB=\" parameter.\n\n* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one\n  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you\n  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is\n  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.\n\n* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and\n  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces\n  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three\n  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following\n  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand\n  information):\n\n     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for\n\tsomething like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,\n\tyou can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact\n\tAdaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains\n\teverything that you need.\n\n     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the\n\tsame people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM\n\tdrivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know\n\tthe list price, but I've seen this package sold for around\n\t$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS\n\tdriver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,\n\tyou may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.\n\n     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been\n\tobsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in\n\tcase someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the\n\tdrivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410\n\tkit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of\n\tMSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in\n\tthe ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin\n\tboards.\n\n* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows\n  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are\n  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how\n  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the\n  following is secondhand information):\n\n     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large\n\tnumber of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers\n\t(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.\n\n     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup\n\tprogram (see the above section on CDROM drives for more\n\tdetails).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but\n\trequires, ASPI4DOS.\n\n* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:\n\n     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.\n     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.\n     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and\n\tCorelSCSI! drivers/programs.\n\n  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:\n\n     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI\n\tdrivers).\n\n* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar\n  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you\n  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used\n  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know\n  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,\n  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:\n\n\tPD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>\n\tASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx\n\tASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10\n\tASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr\n\n  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might\n  have it, if any forum does.\n\n* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are\n  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.\n  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and\n  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work\n  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of\n  BSD Unix).\n\n* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS\n  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked\n  like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I\n  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still\n  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first\n  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version\n  doesn't.\n\n\n\f\nLocal Variables:\nfill-column:\t72\neval:\t\t(auto-fill-mode nil)\nEnd:",

XT drives\nusually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The\ntwo are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be\nable to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be\nable to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I\nthink). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the\nXT.\n-- \nTimothy Hu timhu@ico.isc.com     | The intelligence (or lack of) expressed\nInteractive Systems Corporation  | above does not necessarily reflect\nResource Solutions International | that of anyone else.\nalso:thu@grips0.uwyo.edu",

Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip\nan Apple salesperson said \"it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip\" {Not at a 6MB/s,\n10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra\nuses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see\nSCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven\nin the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH\nFASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.\n\nDon't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on.\nOne reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is \n(Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)).",

Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of\nhandling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser\nMaster Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.\nIt also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower\nresolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product\nuses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent\nPC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation\nprocessed PS.\n\nThe quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for\nthe PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.\n\nWe were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was\naccepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts\nthe image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript\nprocessor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it\nis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also\naccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but\nWindows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is\nresponsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our\ncamera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's\ndemo though).\n\nI don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be\nsurprised if there are several.\n\nGordon Lang",

        "subject": "Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)",
        "content": "I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have\nthe problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\n1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\n\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,\nbut this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my\nwork (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the\nknowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.\n\ngeoff sherwood",

        "content": "Hi Netters!\n\nI'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about\nmy situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:\n\n1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).\n    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both \n    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / \n    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5\" and 5.25\" floppies.\n\n2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).\n\nFrom what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible\nsolutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these \noptions, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees \nany flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking \n(I don't know very much about these beasts):\n\n1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.\n    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?\n    What do the floppies themselves cost?\n\n\n2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a\n    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any\n    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?\n \n\n3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)\n\n\n4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or \n    recommendations for manufacturers?  \n\nI appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will\nsummarize all responses for the net.\n\nThanks,\n\nGeorge\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n  George J.

        "content": "Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,\nI can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been\ntrying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since\nmy machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]\nHe already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number\nbut I can find out.)\n\nAnyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get\none or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both\nat the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -\nnever gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction\nsheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS\ncorrectly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the\nmaster/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't\nknow PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers\nproperly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).\n\nThe only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've\ntried several combinations:\n\ncontroller - master - slave\ncontroller - slave - master\nmaster - controller - slave\n\nNone of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.\n\nAnother possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into\ntwo seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \"C: drive\" and \"D:\ndrive\" setup info rather than \"drive 1\" and \"drive 2\" like most others\nI've seen.  Could this be confusing things?\n\nSo, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some\ninfo for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper\nabout the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one\nof those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so\nit looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!\n\nMany, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have\ntwo papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.\n\nI just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I\nhaven't seen IDE drives cheaper.\n\n: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card\n: (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down\n: in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc\n: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions\n: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to\n: come down in price.\n\nNo, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because\nnobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:\neasily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or\nMac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.\n\n: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented\n: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better\n: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when\n: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.\n\nOn a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for\nexpandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The\nfollowing are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:\n\nA (partial?) list:\n\t1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them \n\tconcurrently.\n\t2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac\n\tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice\n\twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)\n\t3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For\n\tinstance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor\n\t212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will\n\twork no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the\n\ttermination, plug it in, and away it goes.\n\t4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that\n\tthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is\n\tquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:\n\tto d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very\n\tnoticable, as many things can be going on at once.\n\nOne neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the\nability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with\nlittle problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've\nadded to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to\nhave 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive\nall on the same card.  \n\nSimply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.\n\nGreg.\n-- \n_______________________________________________________________________________\nYou can't go against nature, because when you do, \tGreg Shaw\ngo against nature, it's part of nature too.\t\tshaw@feanor.xel.com \n\t\t\tLove & Rockets\t\t\tuunet!csn!xel.com!shaw",

(at least that's\nhow it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be\nan all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different\nplatforms.\n\nIs there any argument that \nIDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the\ndrive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able\nto deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because\nof a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?\n\n>: Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive\n>: controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do\n>: at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?\n>: What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?\n>\n>No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives\n>at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.\n\nIf data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to\nperform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main\nmemory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE\ncan't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored\nin main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives \nat the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the\nsame time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?\n\n>I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I\n>haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.\n\nA friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245\nmillion bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets\nclose to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few\nhundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?\n\n>No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because\n>nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:\n>easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or\n>Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.\n\nSo you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,\nconsidering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or\ntape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and\nrun DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives\nat the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years\nago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that\nprevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.\n\n>: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented\n>: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better\n>: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when\n>: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.\n>\n>On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.\n\nBut on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you\nget more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have\na single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI\nchoice really give them more performance than IDE?\n\n>But, you bought your PC for\n>expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.\n\nTrue, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option\nis there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.\n\n>\t1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them \n>\tconcurrently.\n\nNo argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the\nbest reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer\neventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single\nhard drive system?\n\n>\t2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac\n>\tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice\n>\twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)\n\nWith all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that\nPC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are, \nis the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/\npartitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?\n\n>\t3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For\n>\tinstance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor\n>\t212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will\n>\twork no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the\n>\ttermination, plug it in, and away it goes.\n\nSo the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this\nreally a problem?  \n\n>\t4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that\n>\tthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is\n>\tquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:\n>\tto d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very\n>\tnoticable, as many things can be going on at once.\n\nAfter having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,\nI have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor\nhave I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or\nto/from the same drive.\n\n>One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the\n>ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with\n>little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've\n>added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to\n>have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive\n>all on the same card.  \n\nThat is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that\nthere is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.\n\n>Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be \na nice bonus but is not expected.\n\nUltimate goal: have room for Linux et al.\nEx of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount\nthe ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.\n\nI have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,\nor can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, \ndepending on setup/jumpers.\n\nUseful suggestions might be:\n- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD\nis expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).\n- Do I need some driver to make it work?\n- --- \" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?\n- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE\nis cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not \nrich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.\n- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change\na chip or put a jumper!\n\nAlso useful:\n- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.\n- ftp archives with relevant info.\n- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't\nseen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)\n- any hints into inner workings of the system ... \n- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )\n\nDirect or posted replies are ok.\n\tMany thanks,\n\t\t\tCat.\n--\n////// /// // / /  /  /   /   /    /     /      /      /        / \nCatalin Ivan - email: ivan@Iro.UMontreal.CA - tel:(416) 324.8704\n         Human-Computer   INTERACTION   Humain-Machine \nUniversite de Montreal - Informatique et Recherche Operationelle",

Do you\n>get more performance for the money.\nOk once again with the SCSI spec list:\nSCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s\n asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s.\nSCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}\n Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1\n so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.\n\nSCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst\n{for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit\n hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1\n devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds}\nSCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst\nSCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n\nOn the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:\n>IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                          \nAgain synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower\n {Range 0-5MB/s}\n>ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)\n\nOne problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by\npeople.  Its PROPER meaning is \"The set of SCSI interfaces composed of\nSCSI-1 AND SCSI-2\"\nLook at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:\n(My comments in {})\n\nPC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 \"Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,\n{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE...\"\n{this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2}\nTo read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:\n{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}\n\"Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the \nspeed of IDE...\"\nor {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}\n\"Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as\nESDI, 20% faster than IDE...\"\n\nNOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.\n\nSCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers \nare VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed\ndegridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}\n\nIf we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking \nabout SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2}\nIT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.",

If you have only one printerport \n( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,\nyou can assign IRQ2, if its free.

The hardware will\nautomagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high\nIRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. \n   I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1\non IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of\nthe interrupts in between. Works just great.\n   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that\ndetails how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the\nhigher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.\n\n  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the \n\nfirst IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response -- \nespecially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no\nproblems.\n\nJustin\n---\njdolske@andy.bgsu.edu",

Either of these make it\npossible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory\nwithout interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move\nthe data.

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk\ninterface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the\ncontroller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main\nmemory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not\ncompatible.\n\nHeck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about\nISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE\ndrives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE\ndid DMA there would be trouble.\n\n(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the\nlast report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it\nwould require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)\n-- \nRichard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.com\nOS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...",

Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that\nthe >=15\" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over\ndistances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore\n*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*\n(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN\nInformation Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and\nprobably only way of having any chance of receiving a \"perfect\" monitor\n(the definition of \"perfect\" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my\ncase quite :).\n\n>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?\n\nI, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard\nmonitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,\nfinally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,\nbut a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying\nconvince me was \"normal\"). The short answer is no, don't accept these\n\"imperfections\" as \"normal\" because for the premium one pays for the\nlarger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and\nif you're persistent, you'll receive it.\n\n>...............................................................\n>:      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             :\n>: Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              :\n>: Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park, NC :\n>...............................................................\n\n\nRegards,\nPaul Yee\nyee@nimios.eng.mcmaster.ca",

It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.\nThere are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and\nthe software.  THAT IS IT.\nLet us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.\n\nSCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}\n asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}\n synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a\n rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}\n\nSCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from\n SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs\n this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers\n AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the \n slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode \n 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous\n mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}\n\nSCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things\n over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the\n machine and the external device.\n Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver\n software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.\n Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.\n\nSCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this\n requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING\n devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY\n expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts\n \n\nAs I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the \ncontroler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to\nonly FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}",

The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.

I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just\nbeen released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed\nseveral monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the\nNanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last\nyear.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the\nranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing\ncriteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I\nscored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it\nscored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.\n\nIncidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading\nreviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the\ncriteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product\ntesting was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly\nknow what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently\nfrom Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the\nranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet\nyour needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of\nwhat we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply\nmore closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell\nanything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you\ndon't also understand the scoring.\n\nWayne Rash",

Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware,\nand therefore your machine can't keep up with things.  Ever notice how when\nacessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I \nimagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time,\nand sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.

By default the parallel\nprinter processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore\nno Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip,\nthus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.\n\n     Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not\nroute interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software\nusually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port\nactivity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably\ngetting the sound card slighty confused!.\n\nWindows may be a different story....",

I'd like to know a few things:\n\n\t- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2\n\t  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example)\n\t- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it\n\t  support (text & graphics)\n\t- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM\n\t- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000\n\t- Support in software\n\nIf anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like\nto know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell\nme about it.\n\n\nFor the people in Holland:\nKan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg\nis?

Do people forget that the IDE was specifically\ndesigned to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen\nIDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times\nit was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When\nyou run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it\nat 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,\nnone of them run at CPU speed.\n\nThe only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to\na caching controller.

As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to\nCOM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(\n\nThere are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows:\nC1\nC2\nS2\nP2\nP1\nG\n\nThe second bank is labeled \"IRQ\" and has the following labels:\n5C\n5S\n4\n3\n3S\n2C\n2S\n\nI have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first\nserial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer\nport as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the \"G\" enables the game port and\nthe \"S2\" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I\nhave tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that\nthis bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t\nknow how.

This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface\n   IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,\n   while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers\"\n                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSo the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the\nrequested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess\nyou could call that a cache :-|).\n\nSo when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a\nmeasly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???\n\nAny of you hard-disk engineers out there know?\n\n\nWondering why my disks are so slow,  \nDavid\n                        o o\n--------------------oOO-(_)-OOo--------------------------------------------\nDavid Stam                            Linux: The choice of a GNU generation\nstam@netcom.com                       386-un*x-X11R5-Openlook-gcc-TeX-FREE!",

I solved it by entering\nthe 'advanced' window on the flex program pannel and changing the\n'color palette'.  Sorry for the vaugeness, I hope it helps some.\n\nBTW, I have a GW2000-66V and 1M ATI GUP.\n\nMatt Sexton    SEXTON@CLAES.SPACE.LOCKHEED.COM",

Some BIOSes do not automatically install \nCOM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which \nwrite directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call \nfails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER.

        "content": "Hi Netters,\n\nAs promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.\nPeople seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\n\nBuddy Christyono\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsummary of replies\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello Buddy,\n\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\n\nHere is my suggestion...\n\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\n\tDOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\n\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\n\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \n\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\n\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\n\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\n\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\n\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\n\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\n\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the \"A\" is better than \"B\" \n\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\n\tI am looking forward to being able to \"LOADHIGH\" the DD sw.  That\n\thas been an annoyance.\n\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\n\teffort to upgrade.\n\nJust my $.02 ...\n\nRegards,\nMark Bagdy\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nBuddy,\n\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\n\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\nsuch).\n\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\nhappy camper.\n\n-Bruce\n-- \n  Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.\nThe only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game\nwas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed\nregion of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. \nThere was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.\n\tCompression performance for the whole disk has held steady \naround 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files \nare compressed image files and some large zip files.  \n\nIf you have any more specific questions let me know.\nDan\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40\nMB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the\nsame product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.  No problems with either\nproduct.\n\n-- \nRon Bjornseth                 bjornset@pogo.den.mmc.com\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n-------------------- END OF MESSAGES --------------------------------------",

We need to\nfix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If\nyou're really interested, though, take a look at the text file\nP9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the\nP9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,\nyou can build up a new monitor definition that has the right\ncombinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy\nof the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT\nfile, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices\nshould show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.\nYou can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of\nthe driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.

My system only had a IDE cable\n: for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors\n: on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, \n: the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable\n: with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But\n: for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug\n: in the cable to align these.  \n\nMost IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed\ncircuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your\nIDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in\nthe receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle\nis center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide\npositioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:\nlook into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On\nall drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin\nis pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard\nfor the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins\n39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep\nthe pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the\ncable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the\npin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But\nbeware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables\nwith pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors\nthis doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide\nwhich side is pin 1.\n\n: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\n: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\n: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the \"master\" drive\n: and which into the \"Slave\"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...\n\nIt doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives\nare jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you\nshould be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the\ndrive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper\nselects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the \ndocuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,\nthen just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have\none.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like\nyourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't\nhave convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice\nhelp.  Or post the specific question to this group.

Fixed disk\nsectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to\nmemory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is\nquite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the\ncontroller/cpu know how to use the bus).

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives \nwhen performing diagnostics.\n   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way \ninterface connector. They have the following functions and are described \nin order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper \ndescribed nearest the 40 way interface connector.\n\nLK2: LED \n     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the\n     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An\n     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with\n     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will\n     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130\n     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.\n\nLK1: Dual Drives\n     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single\n     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,\n     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.\n\nLK4: Master\n     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If\n     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be\n     jumpered in this way.\n\nLK5: IOChRdy\n     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is \n     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher\n     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per\n     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally \n     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per\n     second.\n\n   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)\nmay be jumpered:\n\n     Master, single drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 & LK4 fitted.\n     Master, single drive without LED on interface\tLK4 only fitted.\n     Master, dual drive without LED on interface\tLK4 & LK1 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface\t\tNo jumpers fitted.\n     Master, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 only fitted.\n\n   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to\nreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.\n\n   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way \nconnector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected\nby the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the \ndrive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further\ndetails.\n\n\n\n\n***************************   S E A G A T E   *************************\n\nThere is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM, SCSI, ESDIand IDE) on\nevery Simtel mirror under\n\n/msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip\n\nIt contains info about the following drives:\n\n\t    st1144a\tst138a\t    st274a\tst3283a\nst1057a     st1156a\tst1400a     st280a\tst351ax\nst1090a     st1162a\tst1401a     st3051a\tst9051a\nst1102a     st1186a\tst1480a     st3096a\tst9077a\nst1111a     st1201a\tst157a\t    st3120a\tst9096a\nst1126a     st1239a\tst2274a     st3144a\tst9144a\nst1133a     st125a\tst2383a     st325ax\n\n\n*********************\tT E A C   **************\n\nModel: SD-3105\n\n                Cyls.

The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique\nElectronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.\nThis is a \"physical layer\" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.\nThe analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while\nthe particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or\nI) physical identification scheme (number).\n\nBut to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)\nit is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the\nmanufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a\nreason to ever do that.\n\nIf your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly\nchangable.  But it is strictly software.\n\nGordon Lang",

Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what, when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS), my HD refuse to boot.  \n\nJust my 2 cent.\n\nJim",

This frees the\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\n\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\n\n> \n> Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,\n> but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):\n> \n> \"The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board\n> direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers.\"\n> I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.  \n> So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT\n> HDD controller doesn't!?!?

So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels\nare not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe\nrecocnize them and tests them ok until first access). \n\nWell, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a\nspecial test program for dma problems? I eliminated the \nproblem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it\nmakes the system slow!\n\nThanks for your help.\nYours Markus",

I keep \ngetting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the \nprogram. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so \nI can't seem to explain why it crashes.\n\nAll it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and\nafter a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads\nme to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.  \n\nDoes the program take memory up when it is calling void functions\nthat do not return anything??\n\n\tI have been working on this problem for days and I would really\nappreciate any responce.

Normally, the older boards have\na 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char\nthey received.

But if you are\nrunning a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the\ncpu cannot work the whole time with one task. \n\nThe result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.\n\n> 4) Is it only for internal modems?\n\nNO.

Try \nreplacing the battery.\n\nIf, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power\nthe CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a \nmore normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave\nyour PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor \ncharged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.\n\nIt's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is \ncorrupting the CMOS.

I have 2\nIDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and \n1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also have\na Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC \nbefore.  As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.\nHowever, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has to\nbe the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other \ncontroller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI).\njust set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it.\nThen, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to \nID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you \nhave more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so\non.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it.\nGood Luck!\n\nWilliam",

I\ndon't know what other corrections were made.\n\n2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work.\n\n3) Download glb05.exe.  Format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a\nconfig.sys or autoexec.bat.  Run the self extracting archive so all the files\nexplode to the disk.  Run the file fsh.exe.

Ideas and info gladly accepted.)\n\nI do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation\nfor ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-\nmodem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't\nreally a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial\nI wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,\nbut you should still check your software!\n\nI will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is\na commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a\nmodem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications\nhardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA\nCommunications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the\nconnector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is\na \"DB-25\" but IBM has set an alternative \"standard\" of DB-9.  The primary\nsignals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).\nThere are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.\nFor example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate\nin communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an\noutput on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that\nit is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)\nsignal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's\nfive signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)\nsignal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used\nto ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok\nvia the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input\nto the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)\nare Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs\nto the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -\na signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection\nto the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.\nDCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the \"connection\" has been established\ni.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh\nthere are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have\nexplained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:\n\nName    DB-9     DB-25\n SG       5        7\n TD       3        2\n RD       2        3\nDTR       4       20\nDSR       6        6\nDCD       1        8\nRTS       7        4\nCTS       8        5\n RI       9       22\n\nNow to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE\nto a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232\nsignal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert\nthe CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these\nsignals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If\nthis is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,\nand crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other\nend, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send\ndata has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just\nsend the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would\ninclude the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the\nsoftware area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-\nware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the\nserial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to\nbe used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-\nLink or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The\nonly thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also\nfairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And\nthat is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for\nflow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the\nDTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the\nDCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast\nto the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by\nasserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can\nsend.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow\ncontrol?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,\none common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no\nwires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF\ncommands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware\nflow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because\nyour data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol\nsignals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract \"escape\"\ncodes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-\nware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to\ndo it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods\nis to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair\ngame.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.\nBut I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with\nall of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,\nI am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control\nthe RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the\nclear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a\ndiffernt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling\nstuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS\nsignal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-\ning it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the\nRTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other\npossible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain\nsignals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would\nmean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting\nthe DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like\nthis.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more\n\"gotcha\" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to\nsee the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the\nDTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but\nthe RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And\nof course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must\npass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,\nif any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not\nspecify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use\nthis one.\n\n    TD  ------  RD\n    RD  ------  TD\n    DTR ------ DSR\n    DSR ------ DTR\n    DCD ------ RTS-\\\n  /-RTS ------ DCD |\n  \\-CTS        CTS-/\n\n\nGordon Lang",

        "content": "Hi:\n\nI need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!\nI want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:  \n\n     -\tEditing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)\n\n     -\tCreating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)\n\n     -\tEditing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under \n\tWindows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel\n\n     -\tUsing the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, \n\ttalking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of\n\tthe images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.\n\nI've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,\nand decided that a \"nice\" system (price/performance) would be:\n\n\t486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram\n\tATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus\n\t15\" monitor, 1280x1024 NI\n\t3Com Etherlink III 16bit\n\tMaxtor 240MB IDE hard drive\n\nHowever, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these\ntogether, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise\nsurprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even\nhave a 50MHz local bus running...\n\nI have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\n486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\nthe non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\nthat I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any \nspeedy help would be appreciated even more!!)\n\n\n\nBTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following \nconfiguration:\n\n\t486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram\n\tATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram\n\t14\" monitor, 1024x768 NI\n\tSMC Ethercard 8 bit\n\tMaxtor 120MB IDE hard drive\n\nWe're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!\n~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or\nbeen uncovered!  \n\nThere doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish\nrunning the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take\na long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).\n\nThere's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive\ndon't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with\nmedium size images.\n\nI have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\nmachine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \non the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\ntransfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \nimages).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\nmake a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice \n(above), for that reason.\n\nAlso, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!\n\nAny information is greatly appreciated.\n\n-----\nRoss Mitchell, Imaging Research Lab, |   rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca\nJohn P. Robarts Research Institute   |\nP.O.

This requires that the\nCPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive\ncontrollers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA.

The floppys have their own processor on their controller\nboard which handles all of these commands.\n\nThe difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are\nintelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the\nCPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor\nto transfer their data.\n\n>>Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,\n>>thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.

Most SCSI cards will\nalso DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore\nallowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept\nas dettach/callback.  \n\nCan you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system?\n\n--David Willmore\n\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwillmore@iastate.edu | \"Death before dishonor\" | \"Better dead than greek\" | \nDavid Willmore  | \"Ever noticed how much they look like orchids?

        "content": "In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine\nwithout spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor\non those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them).\n\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with\neither 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing\npower by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions.\nThis chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz\nmachine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz.\nnote: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if\nyou are running Windows.\nOr, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX\non it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you\nwere running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed\nof your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even\nif your original processor runs at a slower speed.\nThere is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX\non it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.\n\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX\nor a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,\nthen you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and\nreplace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for\nboth normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip\ncosts $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the\n25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math\ncoprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the\nOverdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a\n20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally\nand 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is\nrated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.\n\nYou should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that\nadvertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop\naround as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for\na particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.\n\nLawrence Khoo\n\n-- \nkhoo@husc3.harvard.edu       Lawrence Khoo       Computer Consultant\nkhoo@haavelmo.harvard.edu    (617) 496-8992    Econ.

Some lists serve the\ngeneral cdrom community with focuses on library, government and\nnetwork usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted \nto publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,\nand ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.\n \nThe reason for the division into three groups is a natural\npartition of interest between the hardware and software topics,\nand between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext\nand multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, \nPhoto CD and other related formats would be included as well. \nTopics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly\nhardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and\nother legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in\nthe purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other\nnonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom\npublishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as\nindex and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom\nsimulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging\nsoftware, data capture software, data clean up, compression,\nencryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that\naids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and\nvideo.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that\nrelates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,\nsuch as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as\ninformation that publishers need to know about the hardware that\nthe intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will\neventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.\n \nNotes\n-----\nThese groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or\nquestions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or\nquestions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.\nRequests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general\ntopics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms\nmounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.\n \nCharter\n-------\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.software, will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n\tIndex and retrieval software\n \n\tAuthoring software\n \n\tScanning and imaging software\n \n\tOCR and OCR cleanup\n \n\tHypertext\n \n\tSGML\n \n\tPremastering and Simulation (cdrom) software\n \n\tCopyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms\n \n\tOther nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.hardware, will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n\tCD-R equipment\n \n\tData capture hardware\n \n\tScanners\n \n\tVideo and audio capture hardware\n \n\tNetworking hardware\n \n\tMidi hardware\n \n\tPhoto CD hardware\n \n\tPublishing systems\n \n\tCDI and DVI hardware\n \n\tCompression and encryption hardware\n \n\tKeyboarding\n \n\tOther hardware publishing topics\n \nProposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA\n \nThe USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for \ndiscussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:\n \n\tMultimedia authoring software\n \n\tImaging software\n \n\tAudio and Midi software\n \n\tColor control software\n \n\tVideo editing software\n \n\tAudio editing software\n \n\tMultimedia utilities useful for publishers\n \n\tIntegration of text, image, audio and video\n \n\tCompression and encryption of multimedia\n \n\tMultimedia copyright and related legal issues\n \n\tMultimedia databases and hypertext\n \n\tOther multimedia publishing topics\n-- \n\tHenry Manaster          *     EMail: manaster@yu1.yu.edu\n\tBrooklyn, NY            *\n\tDisclaimer: The above is not necessarily MY opinion nor that \n\t\t\t\tof anyone else :-)  ????!",

Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even\n| have a 50MHz local bus running...\n\n| I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\n| 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\n| the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\n| that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \n\nHaving in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.\nIt has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized\nby the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may\nshare experience on that.)\n\nAlso, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal\ncache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.\nSo my advice is the 66/VLB.\n\n| We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!\n| ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or\n| been uncovered!  \n\n| There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish\n| running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take\n| a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).\n\n| There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive\n| don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with\n| medium size images.\n\nHave You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have\npaging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is\ncached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more\nmemory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).\n\n| I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\n| machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \n| on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\n| transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \n| images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\n| make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice \n| (above), for that reason.\n\nThe bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from\n0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the\nsame results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed\n(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is\nlousy.\n\n| Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!\n\nThe rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come\nout. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only\nsell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB.\n\n| Any information is greatly appreciated.\n\nJust some view, not much figures.\n\n--\nPenio Penev  x7423 (212)327-7423 (w) Internet: penev@venezia.rockefeller.edu\n\nDisclaimer: All oppinions are mine.",

Think *very* carefully.\nUnless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want\nto trade elsewhere.\n\nDespite the fact that they answer the phone, \"Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're\nhaving a GREAT Day!\", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return\na modem that didn't work as I expected it to.\n\nThe details:\n\nI ordered one of their house brand \"Infotel\" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.\nIn reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over\nthe name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not\nhave ordered it, had I known this in advance.\n\nIt arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was\npreconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.\n\nFor several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the\ntime I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.\n\nAlthough the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or\n14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After\nspending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested\ndisabling the COM2 port.\n\nThis appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long\nterm solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both\nwould not be in use at the same time as the modem.\n\nI called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail \nhell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I \nwas then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they \ndidn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.\n\nI called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA\nnumber. She promptly switched me to a \"Tech Support\" rep that implied that\nit was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA\nnumber. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I\nwas not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does\nnot work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more \nthan the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local\ncharitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered\na Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.\n\nFor $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know \nwill support their users and sold by a company (based on personal\nexperience) will treat me right if there is a problem.

I'm not sure\nif the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier\nmodems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.\n\nagain, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated\nthe Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you\nwant a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find\npeople who HAVE worked with the Sportster.\n\npersonally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd\nbuy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this\nis exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right\nnow.\n\nand now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want\nto get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to\ncomp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll\nget in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you\nmay get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts\ncomplete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to\navoid spreading faulty info).\n\n>The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression.\n\njust as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in\neither CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only\noperate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is\ncurrently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary\nmode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.\n\nand just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also\nsupported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).\n\n>The difference\n>with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. \n\ntake a second look at the original question:\n\n>In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says:\n>>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external\n                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nsee the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST\nmodem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier\nV.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it\ntherefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.\n\nalso, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb\nversion of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are\neven older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.\n\n>This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of\n>the same type unit to achieve this speed.\n\nHST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about\nHST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a\nproprietary modulation scheme.\n\n>The Sportster will do\n>asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way\n>only.\n\nI do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some\nway.....\n\nfirst off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is\npart of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a\nfeature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter\nin the Courier DS manual).\n\nsecond, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an\nasymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed\nin both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,\nand has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed\nchannel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if\nyou're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of\ninfo back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,\na penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse\ndirections.\n\nV.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full\ndata rate in both directions at the same time.\n\nthird, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with\nsymmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.\n\n>The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.\n\nagain, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable\nto whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large\nfootprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an\nupgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which\ncould eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two\nupgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.\n\nlater.....\n   --jim\n\n--\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W\nAMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

        "subject": "Re: Any info on Cyrix 486DRu2 chip?",
        "content": "It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible\n486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:\nAnd also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.\n\nThe 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX\nsocket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.\nthe 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any\nsoftware query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the\ncoproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the\nactual coprocessor.\n\nThe internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit\nrate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance\nboost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a\n386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and\nQAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,\nis about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is\naround the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,\nand DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2\ncompatibility, but I didn't test it.\n\nThe 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually\na small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains\nthe logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX\nPGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board\ndoubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when \naccess to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available\nfrom Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20\nonly.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.\nIf Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need\nto put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...\n\nI also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K\nexternal cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still\nsignificantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.\n\nIMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or\ncan't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,\nbut if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure\nabout the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't\nbeat it in any significant way.\n\nThe last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,\nasking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:\n\nTreasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.\n1-800-677-9781\nThe 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00\n\nBut....\n\nI liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.\nIf you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you\nmore info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,\nSo I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions\nregarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.\n\njamesc\n909-396-0408\n\n\n-- \n=========================================\nIf someone asks if you are a God, you say...

This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit\nprocessor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s\nPentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions\nper clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola\nis expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two\nconfigurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50\nSPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance\nfor the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89\nperformance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down\nversion of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000\nworkstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip\nwith protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus\nbuilt in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the\nMicro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop\nPowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,\nincluding ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source\nnoted.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has\nbeen extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive\narchitecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million\ntransistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to\nbe priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s\n486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one\nsource said.\n\n==== END REPOST ====",

SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.\n 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using\n SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which\n results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit\n and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software\n drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI\n interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term\n 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},\n 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit}.\n\n8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 \nthat I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software\ncontrolers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds\nfor SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT\nNEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit\nSCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1\nelectornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider\n16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but\n4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1\nbut is 8-bit SCSI-2.\nRule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.\n\n8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost\ncompared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.",

It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,\nv.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so\nyou can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone\nline.  They will \"fall back\" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even\ndisable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to\nconnect with slower and older modems.\n\nIt has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with\nmulti-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).\n\nThey use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)\nwhich reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and\ncleanest connection possible.\n\nThese modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech\nsupport (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.\n\nThey also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the\nNEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which\nwill let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows\napplication just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of\nany font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax\ngraphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,\nas well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).\n\nI'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or\nbelow the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an\nequivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is\nbacked by a company that will never go away.\n\nThis price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of\ndowntown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home\nto pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal\nmodem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including\ninstallation.)\n\nIf you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem\nat an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for\nabout ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.\n\nIf you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at \n(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.\n\nThe modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.\n\nThanks.  \nPete",

This is best achieved\n   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.\n   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)\n\n3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.\n\nOK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC\nwhich will act as a universal sync decoder.\n\nI want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync\npulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting\nthe -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.\n\nThere are 2 reasons for doing this\n\n1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're\n   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.\n\n2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the\n   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my\n   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,\n   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.\n   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA\n   will cut things down to 2.

There is no way to boot from the\n  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives.\n\n* You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though),\n  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI\n  drive.

Will there be a noticable\n>     decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate?\n\n     For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers\ngenerally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher\nthroughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk\n($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a\ngood SCSI controller.\n\n     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're\nused with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).\nUnfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking\noperating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is\nmostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to\nconnect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.\nHowever, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.\n\n     If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's\ncheaper, and you'll have less headaches.\n\n> 4)  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my\n>     hard-drive (bernoulli box, CD-rom, Tape Drive, etc).\n\n[ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what\n  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]\n\n     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,\nwhich probably don't exist unless you're using one of the \"better\"/\"high\nperformance\" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI\ncontrollers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and\ndrivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular\nname-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased\n(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:\n\n* Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI\n  controllers.\n\n* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).\n  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card\n  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.\n\n     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape\ndrives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it\nworks only with Adaptec controllers.\n\n> 5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a\n>     SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar\n>     equipment.\n\n     Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a\nhigh-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound\nright, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers,\nyou'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound\ncards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and\nWindows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI\ncontroller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape\nbackups).  If you want a copy of my \"Adaptec 1542 hints and tips\" file,\nsend email.\n\n     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card;\nthe problems are really with the general hardware and software design of\nthe PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card\nis what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.\n\n     SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC\ncompatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows\n3.1, stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'll\nhave to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than\none SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the\npossible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say, \"probably\", because,\nwhile I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this really\nwill be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will, but I don't know\nfor sure.  ]",

My\n>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.\n\nRunning MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the\nfollowing is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified\nexplanation.\n\nTechnically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer\nadapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that\n\"Something's happening here, please take note.\" How the CPU is\nprogrammed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.\nIn MS-DOS, the \"interrupt vector\" is used to store the address of the\nfunction that handles each interrupt.\n\nNow, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready\nto print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When\nDOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,\nwait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to\nthe LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's\nfree for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. \n\nWith any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing\napproach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU\ncycles.) Hence, you can't \"share\" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're\nrunning Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.\n\nAnother issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses\ninterrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what\nto play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is\nrequired to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is\nneeded.\n\nYou can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use\nthem only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine\nis same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came\nfrom. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.\n\nRemember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the\ngeneral picture correctly enough.\n\nCheers,\n\n-- \n               Juha Liukkonen, aka jliukkon@cc.helsinki.fi\n              University of Helsinki,  Dept. of  Lost Souls\n           \"Trust me, I know what I'm doing.\" - Sledge Hammer",

The manual and installation\nprogram recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to\nIRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now\nI have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this \"cascade to\nIRQ8-15\" business?  \n\nA related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that \nonly DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about\n32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus\nextension to do 32-bit DMA?\n\nYet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang\nthe machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode??\nCivilization however works fine ( at least so far).

Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and\nwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller\ncard on my ISA 486-50.\n\nI'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.\nAnd I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)\nabout buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting\nsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this\nnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and\nthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?\nObviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would\nYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?\n\nAlong those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I\nwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?\nAnd how much would it cost?\n\nI actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook\nup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.\nActually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and\nown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a\nSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI\nHD's SCSI-2?\n\nThanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.\n\nRandy",

It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and\n800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth \nmonitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor,\notherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)\n\n  If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you should\ngo to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in the\nvideo sig.

It's still\nfaster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression,\nI've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin\nload before anything else.  With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys\nor autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.\n\nPersonally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those\nhooks and stuff.

Software drivers often allow for better\nperformance, though.

That's not a big\ndeal (as long as the drivers are available), because you won't have to\nfight with any low memory problems either.\n--\nSegmented Memory Helps Structure Software",

        "content": "[discussing the use of IRQ 7]\n\nIn  recent article msprague@superior.mcwbst311b (Mike Sprague) writes:\n\n>I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written\n>(I can't prove it's true, but I believe it), LPT1 does not\n>actually use IRQ7, even though that interrupt is supposed to\n>be dedicated to LPT1.\n\nTo put it a little differently:\n\n - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the\n   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.\n\n - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's\n   time to send out another byte to the printer.\n\n - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable\n   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between\n   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the\n   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it\n   in the high-impedence mode.\n\n - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate\n   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines\n   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't\n   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes\n   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically \n   disconnected by a jumper.\n\n   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold\n   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true\n   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and\n   that certainly isn't a requirement.)\n\n - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the\n   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance\n   reasons.  \n\nAnd the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.\n\nJoe Morris / MITRE  (jcmorris@mitre.org)",

These drives\n: are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb\n: disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the\n: prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently\n: not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to\n: develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there\n: any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?\n\nCertainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a\ncheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP\n200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more\nexpensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.\n\nA couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb\nflopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do\nthey need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy\ndrive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk\nand hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.\n\nOn the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a\nPCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing\noptical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a\nproduct themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format\nis a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is\nidentical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was\nquoted as saying that a 2.5\" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data\nthough he refused to comment on any possibility of this being\nproductized.\n\nThe article said that one of the problems holding back development in\nthis area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2\ndistinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it\nprobably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it\ninto the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it\nprobably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead\nto get MDs accepted.\n\n--\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndavid shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625\n                inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq\n\t\t\"They didn't like the rates, they don't like the poll tax,\n\t\t and they won't like the council tax.\"   - Nicholas Ridley",

Of course,\nthis means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least this\nwill allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X.\n\nI agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card\nfor specialized free software, avoid Diamond.

ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use\nsystem that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I have\nbeen able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,\nand blue.

I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr.\nit is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly\n4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the\ncontroller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest\nbut does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast\nspeed. I haven\u00b4t used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdieter\n\n-- \nDieter Fritzsche                                      dieter@dischw.toppoint.de\nMaehlsweg 32 ,D-2300 Kiel 17, Germany                         Master of the WOM\nTel   .: +49 431 362705 (Voice)\nFAX\\BOX: +49 431 361437 ZyXEL-V.fast-Waffle/FAX\t\t compuserve  100060,654",

While PCs use pin 2 for RxD and pin 3 for TxD, modems normally\nhave those pins reversed! This allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2\nto pin 2 etc. If you connect two PCs, cross RxD and TxD.\n \n  If hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection\ncan be used. Connect:\n        GND1    to    GND2\n\tRxD1    to    TxD2\n\tTxD1    to    RxD2\nAdditionally, connect (if software needs it):\n        RTS1    to    CTS1 & DCD1\n\tRTS2    to    CTS2 & DCD2\n\tDTR1    to    DSR1\n\tDTR2    to    DSR2\nYou won't need long wires for these!\n  The null-modem connection is used to establish an XON/XOFF-transmission\nbetween two PCs (see software section for details).\n  Remember: the names DTR, DSR, CTS & RTS refer to the lines as seen from\nthe PC.

(It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5\" drive).\n\nI took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.\n\nHowever, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.\n\nIs there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it.\n\nThanks!\n\nCheers, Ben\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBen J.

My\n>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.\n\nSimple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be\nsome confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use\nthe same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it\nis not possible to have both cards active at the same time.\n\nHere is an example.  For some time, I was short of \"free interrupts.\"  I had a\ntape controller (not a \"floppy tape\") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an\n*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my\nmodem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and\nthe tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt\nhandler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate\nan interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape\ncontroller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would\nmost likely \"hang.\")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it\ninstalls an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for\nthe serial port.\n\nUnder DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the\nstatus of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.\nThat's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.\nTry that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)\n-- \nKenneth R.

It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at\nthat res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)\nissue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in\nimage quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any\ndifference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one\nof the two types.

COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM\nport, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just\nsearches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The\nfirst equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by\nthe rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set\nof \"standard\" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the\norder in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for\nserial ports.\n\nSo, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were\nthis address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS\nto determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the\nfield in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that\nthere are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly, I don't know of a simgle\nprogram that would actually have a problem with this.)\n\n--\nBob Nichols\nAT&T Bell Laboratories\nrnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com",
