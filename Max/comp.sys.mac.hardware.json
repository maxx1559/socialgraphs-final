They may have other patents like this.\n\nApple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably\nincludes the internal data structure (which has never been officially\ndocumented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.\n\nI'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data\nstructure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they\ncame up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they\nwon't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,\nthere aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime\nmovies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and\ntransferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't\nmatter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.\n\nI remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,\nand that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What\nother patents does Apple have on the Mac?\n-- \nJoe Schwartz       E-mail: xor@acm.rpi.edu  or  xor@clotho.acm.rpi.edu\nMapInfo Corp.\n200 Broadway       These are my own opinions.

        "content": "Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for\n$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\n5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\n\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see\nthe drive there's a definite hardware problem.\n\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\n\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\nrecovery.)\n\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \n\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\nBut c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\na letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even \nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\n\nWhat's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any\nother products from La Cie in the future.\n\nBill Krauthammer\nf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\n\nPS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service\nhas been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like\nthat. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and\nI'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future."

I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called\n8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression\nfrom the cpu to the AM29000 on the card.

I must say that the connections between the power supply\nand the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be\nbadly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the\nlast\nphase (lower Voltage).\n\nSo you can do following if you are used to such technical terms.\n1) Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray\n2) readjust the 5 Volt level of your powersupply\n3) use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowinÔ through the floppy!\n   (a fixed piece of paper can prevent this)\nif you don't know how to do it beg a friendly technician!\n\nChristian Bauer\n\nbauer@informatik.uni-ulm.de"

The only reason\nto get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep \nin mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.\nThis lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards.

Some new\ndrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data\nwrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform\na test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical\ntolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*\ntrack drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This\nbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and\nso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it\nseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of\nboosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.\n\nI first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed\nout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when\ndigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers\nexplicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT\nto be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nVictor"

This week's MacWeek\nreports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess\nis that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price\nstructure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.\n\nYour price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for\nmine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new\nmachines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my\nIIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me\nto purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel\nbetrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next\nweek (heh).\n\nBottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait\nuntil the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as\nwell wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and\nthen the units which follow them.  You may save some money but\nyou've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the\ncomputer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous\nstate of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them\nagain (grin).\n\n-John\nKomp@leonardo.src.honeywell.com"

It has an access of 200ms and a data\ntransfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is\navailable from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two\nmail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since\nI've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped\nto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The\nCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,\nwhich supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to\nattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the\nCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly\nlower price with two free CDs.\n\nThe Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I\nthink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the\nthree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple\ncatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo\ncd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of\nwhich are pretty good.\n\nThe NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and\na data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around\n$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible\nbefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of\nthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's\nunless you buy it in a bundle.\n\nOf the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the\nApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's\ncompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's\nspeed and performance. \n\nBTW, the models of the drives are:\n\nApple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)\n\nCD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it\nis also something like with 3401)\n\nNEC:  CDR-74\n\n\nI'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems\nwhatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am\npretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.\n\nAlso, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as\nthe president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,\nmy hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is\njust a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the\nenormous chinese community.

        "content": "I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec\nfor very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)\n\nI have a Quadra 950. \nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\n         (using block-mode transfers)\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\n\nLet's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\n\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)\n\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \n\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\n        ...\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\n\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\naccess data at the same time.)\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n--David\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| David Blume            | \"I get tired thinking of all the things I  |\n| dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don't want to do.\"  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+"

At the moment I am leaning towards\nthe Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)\nbut are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the\nmonitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?\n\nPlease send me e-mail and I'll summarize.\n\nI would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order\ncompanys that sell monitors or cards.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nEggert Thorlacius\nUniversity of Iceland"

(Sorry for length).\n\nTo increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed\nfrom 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.\nThis is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some\naluminum foil down to work on.\n\t1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.\n\t2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,\n\t\tspreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.\n\t3. Remove the flopy drive.\n\t4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting\n\t\tthe supply straight up and out.\n\t5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom\n\t\tside of the fan and lifting straight up and out.\n\t6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and\n\t\tright side of the board and sliding the board forward then\n\t\tlifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the\n\t\tboard must be removed first)\n\t7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).\n\t\tThis is not easy even for a skilled solderer.\n\t8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins\n\t\tby pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.\n\t9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder \n\t\tthem in.\n\t10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.\n\t11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and \n\t\tthe other large chip just to the right of the processor and\n\t\tfigure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a\n\t\tsimple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole\n\t\tin the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using\n\t\tinsulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat\n\t\tsync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.\n\n\t12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.\n\nDisclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.\n\t    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will\n\t    void your warentee.\n\nBye for now,\n************************************************\nRalph Durtschi    (208) 236-3256\nIdaho State University\nEMAIL:  durtralp@ux1.isu.edu\n************************************************"

The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard\nnumber (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could\nnot do ANY warrenty repairs.

Though for how much longer remains\nto be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out\nan educational discount.

The critical information from the neuron is in\nthe firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per\nseconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the\nsignal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit\nconvertor is more then sufficient.\n\nAC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases\nyou are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled\nalso. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If\nthe cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly\ndistorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the\noccurrence of the spike that is important. \n\nHowever, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start\nbattling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue were\nto start looking for the technical specifications.\n\nPeter.  \nroes@vax.oxford.ac.uk"

Since they aren't fixed in position on their\nstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different\nposition. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of\ncontact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing\nthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the\nball, not the center cylindrical area.\n\nI've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but\nneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our\noffice's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one\ncould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might\nhelp.\n\nI would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If\nyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl \nalcohol.

Gurman) writes:\n>    The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only\n>(can't say for certain about the Models 125 and 133), so your best bet\n\nThat's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\nof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered\nDESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used\nwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.\n\nMy advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:\n\n(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add\n    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\n    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\n\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\n      self-terminated or not.\n    - configure MacTCP to use \"Ethernet\".\n\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\n      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable\n      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).\n    - get a 25ohm terminator.\n\nYour two-machine network will look like this:\n\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                           |\n      +-----+                                         +-----+\n                                                      |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n     5000/200                                           650\n                              OR\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n        {=}                                             |\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                         +-----+\n      +-----+                                         |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n5000/25,125,133,240                                     650\n         \n   ##    -> 25ohm terminator\n   T     -> T connector\n   ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)\n   {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter\n   []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)\n   |\n   |\n\nAndy\n-- \nAndy Sun (andy@ie.utoronto.ca)          4 Taddle Creek Road, Toronto\nComputing Coordinator                   Ontario, Canada.

I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked\nit, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is\nalso too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels\nare rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do\nwith tarrifs being lifted I think). \n\nIn Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about\n$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For\nthat kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam\nprojector, but sacrifice portability.\n\nOh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if you\nwant your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that\nlight wash out your display at the front of the room. Tricky to get right."

Oh, well . . .\n \none more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the\nnewer models are different from the connection used on the plus---\nyou're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus\nand connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in\nother words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible.\nit's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.\n \nomt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution\nso others can, too. thanx for the input.\n \n*****************************************************************\n*  Tis the blink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath,        *\n*  From the blossoms of health, to the paleness of death,       *\n*  From the gilded saloon, to the briar in the shroud,          *\n*  O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?                 *\n*                                                 -William Knox *\n*****************************************************************\n*  shagberg@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu                                    *\n*****************************************************************"

The plan I have is to build a small board with a few\ndifferent crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different\nspeeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed when\nI want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any\ncompatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able\nto switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch\nwithout any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed\nand put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would further\nreduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of course\nI would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch\nbut use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and\nroute it directly to the mother board.\n\nI haven't started probing around inside my si yet.

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\"\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\n\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\naccelerator.\n\nPaul"

Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple\ncomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:\n\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \"stick\" in\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\nBCGA65431. You'll recognize this \"sticky button\" symptom immediately if you\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.\n\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \nsuggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\nit worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\n\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\n\nIf the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\nthe details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.\n\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to\nme or post yet another \"sticky-button\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\nwill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy\nto stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the\nnext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.\n\n-- Bill Sloan"

The picture either tilts\nsideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some\n\"spiky\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing\npull-downs etc.\nWith the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only\nsense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a\npicture clear enough to shut down from menu...\nWith the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but\nsometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely\nlost.

Again, make an\noffer if that sounds unreasonable.\n \n \nRasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nRenamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13\"\nmonitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode\n(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output\nNTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a\nRAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg\nSIMMS).\n \nSelling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking\n**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and\npackaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card\ntogether, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a \"bundled offer\"\nfor these items.\n \n------------\n \nCheers. \n\ndan keldsen - djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu\n\n-- \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been:\ndjk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  a.

The relevant parts are:\n\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25\" device mounting bracket]\n\nNote Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\nmount a 5.25\" device.  The service techs I talked to said, \"Oh sure,\nwe stock those.\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\ncut out for a standard 5.25\" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\n5.25\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.\n\nI'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25\" device.\n\nGood luck with your SyQuest.\n\n\t-Fred"

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\n\n\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\n\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\n\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\n--  \n=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=\n Eric Choi - Internet: Eric.Choi@p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org"

This disables the auto-answer \nfunction of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra\n14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.\n\nIn Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.

My configuration is:\n \nModel: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards\nMonitor: MAG MX15F with 16\" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)\n \nI just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my\nnew MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a\nwindow or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.\n \nMy guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.

The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:\n\nA/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to\n200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed\ninputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the\nsame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate\nmust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits\nat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national\nInstruments, at the same sample rate.\n\nD/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of\nthe 4 output channels has its own converter.\n\nThe price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface\nboard (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP's is $2695.

Advice from a grad student.\n\n\tI agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.\nThe important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and \nlearn as much as possible about it.  \n\n\tIn my five years of education in this field, though brief \ncompare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of \nquestion a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into\nElectrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or\nCS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this\nkind of question is irrelevant.  \n \n\tI have come to believe that choosing CS because one \ndoes not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does\nnot like to program is really doing an injustice of building\nand computer and making it useful for something.  Everything\nis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a \npart of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.\n\n\tMy advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision\nbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to \nlearn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your \npersective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to\nexplore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the\nschool would make a student choose a major before her/his\nsophamore year.                  \n\n\tHey you may be so interested in this field that you \ndecided to learn all about the making of computers in which \ncase, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.\n\n\tAbout the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you\nare good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. \nIf you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  \nLike wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.        \n\n- Chung Yang"

Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\n\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\n\t\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\n\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\n\t\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>"

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and\nstarted to experience these problems.\n\nApple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of\npotential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware\n(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power\nmanager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.\n\nNone of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe\n(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I\nhave no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears\nto help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on\nstartup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is\nbeing corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any\nnon-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be\nreset by \"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\" -\nApple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button\nI'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if\nsomeone can decipher Apple's advice for me.\n\nBeyond this Apple suggest that \" you should follow the technical\nprocedures to check the hardware of this Duo\". Since so many others\nappear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there\nhas been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line -\nand quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230\npurchasers who have this problem.\n\nAny more comments from others in the same boat are welcome,\nparticularly Apple Duo engineers :-)\n\ncheers\n\nbrucet\n\n-- \n          bruce tulloch sydney australia - brucet@extro.ucc.su.oz.au\n***complex problems have straight forward, easy to understand wrong answers***"

The Mac\ntests memory, etc. Just before the \"happy Mac face\" normally shows up, the\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\n\nIt doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has\n*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had\nit for over a year).\n\nHere is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --\nseveral permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the\nhead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator\n(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal\nresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another\nidentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.\n\nHas anybody seen this?

(random access memory boards for Apple\nMacintosh PowerBook Duos) \nMacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.\n\nCOPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993\n\nBy Raines Cohen\n\n     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook\nDuos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss\nand other problems.\n\n     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week\nissued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM\nproducts from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.\nOther vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.\n\n     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called\nselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But\nTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with\nnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to\nwake from sleep.\n\n     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part\nnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips\ninstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may\nnot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses\nnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed\nwhile the Duo sleeps.\n\n     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo\ncards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology\nWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are\ncertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.\n\n     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers\nDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is\ncompatible with the slower chips.\n\n     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that\nsome third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner\nof the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally\nwhen in a Duo Dock.\n\n     Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it\noriginally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all\ncustomers free upgrades to cards that fit."

It would have the plus of RocketShare and\nthe minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,\nNuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.\n\nApple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except\nperhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC\nslot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC\naccelerators.\n\nOne potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will\nneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with\nRocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.\n\nApple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs\nwill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC\nand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in\nexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking\nprices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen\nmuch cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.\n\nFirst generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed\nCPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.\nThis should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled\nfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which\nI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do\nthis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as\nstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where\nApple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup\nis in order.\n\nBy the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,\nPentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor\nfront for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.\nAlso, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all\nthe other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent\nright now.\n\nOnce anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market\nposition will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially\nif AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it\nmight). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome\nbattle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not\nguaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of\nseveral.\n\nMark"

        "content": "Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the \nPowerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers:\n(1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes\n(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 \nrunning at 15.87 Mhz.\n(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a \nlot of memory.\n(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors \nthat still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors \nsell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell \nmemory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most \nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \nthe Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine \nCalifornia is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - \n$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that \nare selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.\n(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an \naverage access time of about 25 ms.\n(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a \nbacklit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move \nyour head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or \nnon-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.\n\nOther things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay \nfor it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to \nsell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about \n$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for \nabout $900. \n\nThe answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.\n\nI'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable?

I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on\nthe PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware\nahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing\nhas allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.\n\nIn general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides\nare set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the\nPS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.\nWhen I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.\nI can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the\ntransmission is error free.\nBut straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.\nUnless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human\ntyping.

Like via a modem or via a\nsys-ex dump?\n\nCould anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.\nI wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,\nor just me.\n\nYes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times.

Technically, you only need to take out 2 of\nthe VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything\nbecause the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM.

And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system\n>(a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor.\n\n    This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs\nof those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full\n040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching\nchips.

I think\nwe'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is\nno \"option\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:\nthere is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full\n'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).\nAnd there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other\nthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one\nof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be\ngetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't\nbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.\nIt's not an \"option.\"\n    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s\nthinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot\nrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for\na FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or\nsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to\nreplace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not\nneed to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the\nfull '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.\n\n-Hades"

Technical issues are not terribly important at\nthis point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \"full page\" monitor\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. \nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\napplications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\n\nNow, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\nneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me\nvia email and let me know:\n1. If you would consider buying a \"full page\" laptop screen\n2. How much you would be willing to pay for it\n3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea\n\nAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,\nbut who knows!), please send me some.\n\nThanks in advance!!!\n\n-Mike"

Some\n>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel\n>(the first is preferrable, of course)\n\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\n\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\nbecause\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\nscanning\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\nsome machines).\n\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\nonce\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\nwant to\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\nthe\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\nof\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\nwant\nto make stereo sound.\n\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\nthe\nIBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\n\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\nhardware,\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\nworks.\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\n700/900/950\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\nonly.\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\nspecification,\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\n\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\n\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\nmachine\nyou have.\n\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\n>Lemmings\n>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\n>Glider 4.0\n>OIDS\nand also\nHellcats,\nSuper Tetris\nOxyd\n(and many more, these are just what I've tested)\n\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\n\n\nOther games you list:\n>Armor Alley\n>Spectre\n>Spaceward Ho!\nand also\nPGA Tour Golf\nCivilization\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\n\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\n\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\ndo,\nbut I'm going say it anyway.\nStop cheating on sound!\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\nis about to end.\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\nwork\neven better soon, so use it.\n\nIn conclusion:\nTo Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\nTo Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\nsound\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\nhardware.\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nDisclaimer number 1:\nI don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.\nSo don't write me with sound questions.\n\nDisclaimer number 2:\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like \"the grace period is about\nto end\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\nallowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.\n\nDisclaimer number 3:\nI don't speak for Apple, just me.\n\n-Steve Bollinger"

I believe it is\nthe best solution because of the performance and price.  Why spend $800\nupgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????\n  The brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  It speeds up the internal\nclock speed to 16MHz.  That may not seem like much but it also speeds up\nSCSI transfers.  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm.\nCheck it out.\n\nDavid Lau\nlau@aerospace.aero.org"

It is a 14\" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed\nspecifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video\ncapabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it\ntakes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is\nabout $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of\ncomparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half\na year and I love it.  \nSecond, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a\nSupra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons\nwhy there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only\ncomplaint was that they did not always return my calls.  \nI have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's\n(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.\n\n-David\n\n**** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.\n\nMake sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the\nend.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and\nothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations\ncannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be\ndisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2\nboxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be\ndisabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \"experts\".\n\nMy experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they\nmust have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO\ndrive and Sharp scanner has one for each.\n\nGood luck.\n\nArt Beattie\n==============================================================\nI only speak for myself.\n=============================================================="

According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n\"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity.\"\n                                                     - Frank Leahy"

All present Macs support the use of \n32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw \nallows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-\nbit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y \nindependently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 \ndpi [12\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including \nautosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz \nvertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser \nAug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and \nIIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit \ncolor (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  \nTo keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display \ncapability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit \ncolor.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX \nwill change this.\nIn addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one \nmonitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same \nthing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree \nof overlap of the pictures.\nVRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of \n built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit\n color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. \nSound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became \n standard with the SE/30.\n\nIBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system \ninteracts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing \nBIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation\nof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program \ninteraction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer \nJawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a \nstandard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is \nactually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like \nMac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, \nespecially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present \nthings are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver \nand monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, \nand monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with \nan IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \n the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a \n 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock\n (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals\n from EGA/CGA etc. \nMCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*\n subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA \n and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  \n Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.\nSVGA:  Super VGA*\n This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch \n all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer \n using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating\n as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a \n standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things\n are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting \n factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: \n 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a \n 64K \"window\", etc.\nOther non-SVGA standards: \n8514/a:\n IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions \n like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations \n from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do \n not have interlacing. \nTMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some\n do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.\nXGA:  eXtended Graphics Array\n newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones \n are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at \n 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.\nXGA-2\n Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in\n Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area\n fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-\n exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be \n far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth \n isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other \n companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh \n rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual \n discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.\n*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.\n\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software\n drivers.  \"Fast SCSI-1\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode\n {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are\n 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and\n 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \"fast SCSI-1\". \n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\n\nMac\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \n size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting \n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  \n Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: \n 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \n through put down.\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet \n to DMA.\nNuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:\n ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\" instead of the \n old 12\".\nQuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's \n VLBus - \"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\" (Byte 10/92:128).\n Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.\nCPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  \n Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at \n the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to \n dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each \n NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with \n 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.\n\nIBM\nMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-\nlike SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.\n\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: \nMFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited\n only used with smaller [² 60mb] hard drives.\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. \nESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface\n ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in\n many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of\n hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. \n\nBUS interfaces\n{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working \nwith old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}\nISA\n 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a\n 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).\n 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,\n hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards\n aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}\n while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's\n showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit\n (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  \nMCA {Micro Channel}\n IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\" \n (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components \n involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA \n and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).\nEISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}\n 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to \n self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable \n interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.\nVESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}\n Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}\n 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus \n mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for \n video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of\n their patents (Mel Martinez).\nQuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture\n (Byte 10/92:132).

In development.\n\nOSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]\nand multiple application use.}\nMac\n512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows \nApple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, \nmenu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require \nclone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires \naccess to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM \nchips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support \ninterface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS \nhas the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and \ntherefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control \nover hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with \nsome of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a \ntotally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon \nWtte).\n6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, \n cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  \n Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program \n interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd].

Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as \n real RAM is below 8MB.\n6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.\n6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.\n7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard \n to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present \n non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on\n system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking \n within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing \n can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be \n accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, \n Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable \n IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType \n support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present \n machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is \n both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit \n mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last \n 'free' OS.\n7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than \n 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode \n on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. \n Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades\n {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.\n [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system \n fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any \n RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all \n fonts from the system file.]\nA/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and \n a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS \n is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac \n ROMs.  Price: $709.\nNote: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats \nincluding the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and \nDCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' \nand AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most \nstill play.\n\nIBM\n Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for \nprogrammers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  \nSince hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, \nwhat little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  \nThis results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or \nEPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to \nbetter optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which \nis harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it \nreduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware \nsupport is needed.\nSide note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing \nall feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing \nits Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\"Undocumented Windows\") and \n\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to \nabort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 \n#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC \njudicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no \naction.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of \nchoosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has \nturned down Microsoft's copyright of \"Windows\" which would allow it to charge \na fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).\nMicroSoft OSes\nDOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier \n with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program \n must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS \n Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit \n Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in\n DOS 4.0.\nDOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk \n defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for \n networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} \n (Byte April 1993:44-46).\nDOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).\nWindow 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to \n deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to\n run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the\n equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].\n This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac\n programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and\n still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed\n is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).\n Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS\n counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).\nWindow 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base \n requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. \n Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).\nWindows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  \n Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 \n with built-in peer to peer networking support.\nWindows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the \n swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in \n the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the \n reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM \n but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).\n This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric \n multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in\n networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even\n though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor\n is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993\n (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993\n (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495\n (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).\nOther OSes\nPC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS \n 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).\nDR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} \n and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later \n version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple \n file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).\nOS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,\n 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, \n multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file \n to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. \n IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this \n (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).\nAIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.\nNeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final \n version to be out by May 25, 1993.\nSolaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric \n multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with \n tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and \n communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users\n server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.\nMac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel \n Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM \n (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run \n on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps \n will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to \n Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow \n progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in \n late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}\n\nPowerPC\nRumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; \nMacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA \nvideo (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week \n3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.\nApple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and \nto have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to \nsale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser \n9/92:146)}\n(MacWeek 3/22/93).\nPowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on\n PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain\n (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard\n drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.\n Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.\nPink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92) \n and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and \n PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).\nWindows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.\nSolaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the\n Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state \n that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details\nNeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.\n\nOS Number Crunching (Mel Park)\nMac\n Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard \nApple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an \nFPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or \ntaking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are \nhandled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal \nrepresentation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment \nof 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and \nthe FPU programmed directly.\n\nIBM\n Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when \nemulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever \ncompiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers \nexceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS \nprompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this \nbetter.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, \nWindows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.\n\nNetworking [Includes printing]\nWYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially \nif one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.\nMac\nHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  \nLocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for \neach machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to \ninclude very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in \nEthernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at \nabout $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and \ntransceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.\nThe Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet \ninterface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a \nnetwork option since 1989.\nSoftware: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can \nuse variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS \nas well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, \nBanyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing \nmachines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows \ntypical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version \nwill have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 \n(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC \nPathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software \nbuilt-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. \nPrinting requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in \nthe chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the \nchooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.\nPrinting bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.\n {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}\n\nIBM  \nHardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.\nSoftware: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk \nprotocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.\nEach of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible \nwith the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to \nthat product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more \nforgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, \n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more \ncomplex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac \nfinder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  \nInfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)\nPrinting {Very OS dependent}\nDOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, \n and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written \n software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly \n implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one \n software program to the next.\nWindows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \"jobs\" \n in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \"active\"... even if they \n are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers \n on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine \n which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like \n and intelligent about this.\nOS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.\nPrinting bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do \nnot have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and \nnot that of the OS involved.\n\nPrice issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features \nthan IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars \nby both worlds.\nThe IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware \nstandarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to \nhandle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac \nhardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  \nbuilt-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and \nNuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent \nequipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs \nwhich cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.\n Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.\nAll Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where \nnoted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card \nneeded except for 24-bit color display}.\nIBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA \nmonitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1, \nsound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to \n16-bit color, etc}.\nColor Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz \nequivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor.\nLCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160.\nCentris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or \n~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a \nPDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color.\nCentris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50 \nMHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80}; \n$3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit \ncolor}\n\nBibliography notes\n'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex-\naim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.}\n'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in \ndirectory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC>\n'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  \ntrying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  \nand my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  \nto make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  \nplace to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  \nthat the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  \nwrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  \ncould be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   \nIt could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  \nwrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  \ncorrect actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  \nmy NeXT that way.\n\nNow I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  \nproblem, and at pretty high speeds too.\n\nI don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  \npretty standard.\n\nHope this helps,\n-Avery"

Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer\nscrewed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.\nWell designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur.\nThis usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some\ndevices can \"hiccup\" in the middle of blocks.

The SIMM is a PCB with a 30 pin connector edge\nand on the SIMM are 8 256 kilobit DRAM chips (making the total memory 256\nKBytes.\n \n  You are correct assuming that SIMMs will not fit into a LaserWriter.\nApple printers either require 64 pin SIMMs like those in the Mac IIfx or\nspecial memory chips.

I have heard, though not confirmed\nby apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds.\n\nI also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem\nallowing speeds just as any other serial port.\n\nMy particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to\ninterface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. \nCurrently, we are interfacing using mac pluses.  I set everything\nup just as in lab and nothing.  In fact, the powerbook locks up.\n\nCan anyone help, inform, advise? I would appreciate it.  \nI would prefer email since I don't read the news at all.\nI will post a summary if enough response is generated.\n\nThanks. \n\nFaisal M.

There is already 512K of VRAM soldered \nto the logic board.  You add the two 256K SIMMs to this to give you a \ntotal of 1 MB.\n\n- Dale Adams"

I have only one report, which seems to indicate\n> that a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! \n\nOk.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.\nIt's small enough that I will attach it.\n\nI have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB\ncache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to\n40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective\ndifference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache\ncard certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously\nbetter.  I do not have an FPU.\n\nThe conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers\noffer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference\nbetween 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well\nunder $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.\n\nIf you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to\nsee them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called\n\"Performance Rating\" numbers by themselves are of no interest. \n\nCheers.\n\n(This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)\n:#@0KBfKP,Q0`G!\"338083e\"$9!!!!!!'A!!!!!$qK3%\"a+!!!!BGJ&CfGiGfH(H\n)GhQ!QSQBUC!!@SQUU(QSCfPhGhL(H+HCL&KjQTU)LDH)HBL*UCUCJ!U@GQ9hGiK\nhCAKR9SPiJ)QRQ)QUJ+N(J!UCLD#U#S!!S!QUUTQC#U#DL3J)#3LT#UU)QUUBUT!\n!S!L3!!UU#!QJS+UT!!QJS*UD#TUUQCQ3!*!!UCFJ!!%c4ACSL'D)L)D!#!!)#!!\n!!!!!!!!)!!!!!!!!J!B8*%9@9L0A\"i!!G`!!G`B!!(J)\"i###B!P[US),B\")21Z\n-1I\"k-cQFM-VXMHhA!irdjPcVr,lUCVSZ2SI8j@,-l,jPI`F#lZq0A\"AL8XRHjf,\n6[LJ09\"aZ2TV6l!$9lN@eAP@Rei8(VIpIQkfDK$-ZV[b+9[T5lkC0XZ6LGhf(Ik&\na$Lkh*Q6-qhh2MIlc*Q2Iq$p([GeSp(ejN!\"bHMdHll$&Qh'lR`E26C2(QBqSrMM\npa-k()jPGXqcpR2rYR9eYd0,*Mh0,h1rj1*hA%pcLHRSG6PF2eIYmc4rIS60EFp+\nCGE@Vr$[TRAFA(QkA`pG8JkS[@fe1mcBikFQC(,(9K[U&h\"\"0rr\"BDDT(i%XP3Z$\nV04L8D82FeU01V4K-9U#JaD@1*fZa`EZr3-eGTYkNXH49SjF2Ei[G*5el3[VZ'j[\nVf($bTBHjlEX3Pe0KJ8,ZKH!9Cc3+fJ%kHGZC*BHhNV9+DC6Xd$[S58DFD\"pJ%ei\nq#CXHkEL`@d%&PYYY\"1f0rG`jm0rJTCYMi4B1KbB'pUBQ)PU9'q\"*m1miHG#YR`b\neUNG1'mSAP#mR`i-1*K`l[DiNq'MQjZA(,4bq\"$*Mimq(KC9@@(-Mc'\"f88e9U&0\nF'Y4U5eXb(\"+6T8D@6(R3ae+10Padk\"CAK!*Ea6SThLiA9HF!H&&Da@[,[2bA2!p\n2VIr&TI)!6V`%S!*eJ#GS!Q!!QqD#2P!*M49m9IdHhm2frUq2Ek))G3e\"Vi)+rQJ\nC[`%m#+E&0jf\"YI2ql`VI&0qHH!R[339`'9hY46)TR+ZkXI!pQRQKCU3%ed9R&Cr\n!QCiUk+ZmEf)IYI&bqMEffkT5bB`JhYl2K[0PXVe0B@@2*@Uam121D`A`h+cC)Xl\nIEjf8S+#9`a6[P8p0ZC&6H0ajcY1BR\"JDM3`F%lJ1&5bI+SC2Jh([qeTfVK961rR\nZVIq[+Rb-TH3'B3f0r$h''cP%\"UY1'jU53jY@5P(RCdPAXAfrl\"Xrhf#Y\"dmV1i$\n9%Dm@T+f4NMlP5jd-XN0(K5C91'R@)4Qb9C5Ke1h%V-kiaRA-NTa`b9(YYL5TM5*\nF2#bUFFLGJ%,D8QA*9R`eUQ29Sj!!p0b'\"c5LEFR4@%9KpDGj1,bijhNaDH,6mrm\n(3qpJITeraM0+0RHJ*aJ%f`#HJ!R4JJXDK22e!Cab5DK)jkRq0r[IcrC`[c!Krd(\n$m1VrbJCX!NR)3FrcHYPk(r1CHJjiJ#Hk%'J84pq+#+$a2&r&bZ,Ff1V,-KG6qG9\nMbmUPG9XkUeX$2Gl!Gl!Gl!GE!k5hrX(F4IX4IRNYkb\"M%rSbN4`8m8qPq2rAd[j\nFhRC#4(PeI2RFhY0+j-GH'!P*S)h!#HN!R6JJXb5f'b!clJkfb121qGm2MclEe,S\nmHpf12b4arQ$Q%%PLK\"q(8@I8[qRmmS5[l`\"2fP!\"4CpjY0,DDAp2AlE#eIPBD0c\nrL1,PeXj39[%9k`HF4Z,ZKGN4h9A+b-T23l)RDf'a13X\"'-#VbKJ[!9ME*!Tlp2-\nQckRpM@J2e5BN*f&jHN*[Vp-#f+F(J)PQXJNlYRLpQ3C,%`Cm0l3E[MP\"cXZ6`)B\nmpVS0)P3Y@XTB5F5qaSr\"XrmrZf1iLXSV,pPVjICFMRrekXdDI`0FHmT[Q!4VL`T\naalM336chGUr@\"Me6YarIDI&Y2LpE9HPaI#fhNFmq$qLchVC(dUajJ%eb%(6NdIH\np#jqEd#X1cGDTVmDY965+@Pi,Mr1JeR&pq`q@\"AacVkC[0lZi3-Z-5PZk8%f$Vrd\nHfR&1mci,3&Nqh9r\"e%\"j5Ve$0rN`AbfB\"Qqlk$C`3@LKQRh0(-MKhNYA+UC&Qhq\n5kajHR1eFqR,2H5b8Z!SLfG3!!2TPmiF!!3!+58PcD5eMB@0SC3%!!!!)6@0S9(0\n3C$1R$)JJT`b+33%!ADmicJ!#!!!4a3!!!!!!!!B9!!!!!,AP!!!:\n-- \n ----\nPeter Newton (newton@cs.utexas.edu)"

Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed\nis out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)\n\nThe Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager.

I don't know about sys 7.1,\nbut at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes\nchannels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a\nchannel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many\nsounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.\nThen only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to\ninspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the\nonly way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an\n*undocumented* flag and modify it.\n\nAm I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get\nrid of the bugs.\n\nAny better suggestions? (Silent games is not among the acceptab|e solutions.)\n\n-- \nIngemar Ragnemalm\nDept. of Electrical Engineering\t     ...!uunet!mcvax!enea!rainier!ingemar\n                  ..\nUniversity of Linkoping, Sweden\t     ingemar@isy.liu.se"

They would be much appreciated.\n\n                                    -- Andrew Geweke\n\n---\ndouce@tfsquad.mn.org (Andrew Geweke)\nThe Firing Squad BBS, public access Usenet mail and news.  +1 612 291 2632\nSaint Paul, Minnesota"

Tables of contents for those two pieces are\n  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three\n  sections of this document  before posting. \n  \n         All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from\n  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory \n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory\n  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as\n  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last\n  part of the group name followed by \"-faq.Z\", e.g the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as \n  compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end\n  of  the file name when \"getting\" the file, rtfm will automatically \n  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have \n  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to \n  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/\"name\"  in the body text where\n  \"name\" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.\n  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the\n  subject \"help\" for more detailed instructions.   \n\n    \n\n ==================== \n I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)\n ====================\n  \n       Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is \n  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions\n  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve\n  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used\n  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my\n  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a\n  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box\n  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I\n  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to\n  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. \n  P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) \n  \n       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we\n  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the\n  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other\n  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially\n  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read\n  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that\n  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen\n  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has\n  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,\n  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any\n  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself\n  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup\n  news.announce.newusers.\n\n\n HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) \n     \n         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,\n  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists\n  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ\n  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part\n  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are\n  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this\n  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named\n  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by\n  \"-faq\", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is\n  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use\n  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command \n  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the \".Z\" extension when\n   you \"get\" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file\n  before sending it to you. \n  \n         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned\n  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ\n  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to\n  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere\n  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand. \n  It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a\n  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please\n  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh\n  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear\n  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong\n  where. \n  \n         To jump to a particular question search for\n  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For\n  example to find \"Where can I FTP Macintosh software?\" search for\n  the string  \"(2.1)\".  To jump to a section instead of a question\n  use a zero for  the question number.\n\n\n WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)\n\n      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of \n  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are\n  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list\n  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and \n  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in \n  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list \n  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from\n  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now\n  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently\n  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,\n  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has\n  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of\n  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform\n  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp\n  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim\n  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX\n  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux\n  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at\n  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n\n\n WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)\n  \n      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. \n  You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite\n  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask\n  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft\n  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an\n  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their\n  ways of  communicating.  \n  \n      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your\n  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too\n  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering\n  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one\n  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of\n  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a\n  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,\n  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question\n  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered\n  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few\n  network software designers.\n  \n         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. \n  If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra\n  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important\n  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. \n  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a\n  catch-all newsgroup.\n  \n         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in\n  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs\n  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications\n  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought\n  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps\n  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. \n  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases\n  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions\n  about non-communications hardware including questions about what\n  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software\n  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and\n  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about\n  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk\n  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.\n  \n         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. \n  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development\n  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit\n  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,\n  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the\n  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer\n  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. \n  \n         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY\n  technical question about an application that actually begins to\n  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent\n  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly\n  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)\n  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.\n    \n         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to\n  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We\n  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to\n  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to\n  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and\n  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is\n  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is\n  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not\n  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.\n  \n         Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the\n  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. \n  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more\n  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI\n  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a\n  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place\n  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in\n  comp.sys.mac.\n\n\n 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF\n THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND\n WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?\n\n      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as\n  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to\n  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in\n  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium\n  for answering common questions like this one.\n   \n         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail\n  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it\n  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups\n  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that\n  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the\n  section of this document that answers their question with just the\n  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to\n  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they\n  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.\n\n    \n\n === \n FTP  (2.0) \n ===\n\n WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)\n\n      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,\n  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),\n  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu\n  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several\n  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove\n  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from\n  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was\n  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the\n  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless\n  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document\n  should be available at the above sites.\n  \n       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians \n  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se\n  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in \n  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). \n  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  \n  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). \n  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au\n  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese\n  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n  (130.69.254.254). \n\n         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). \n  This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,\n  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things\n  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material\n  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other\n  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple\n  system software.  Please read the various README documents\n  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're\n  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute\n  material you find here.\n\n\n CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)\n\n      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from\n  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). \n  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH\n  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available\n  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the\n  words \"help\" and \"index\" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your\n  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files\n  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using\n  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a\n  message with just the text \"help\" (no quotes).\n\n\n WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)\n\n      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above\n  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it\n  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject \"help.\" \n  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,\n  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server\n  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi\n  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,\n  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of\n  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as \"archie\"\n  (no password is needed) and type \"prog filename\" to find what\n  you're looking for or type \"help\" for more detailed instructions. \n  For instance you would type \"prog Disinfectant\" to search for a\n  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails\n  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of\n  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with \"prog\n  Disinfectant\", you might try \"prog disi\" instead.  Substring\n  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many\n  erroneous matches add a \".*\\.hqx\" to the end of the substring, e.g.\n  \"prog disi.*\\.hqx\"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in\n  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. \n\n         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE\n  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you\n  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the\n  net where to find a particular piece of software.\n\n\n CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)\n\n      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from\n  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please\n  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about\n  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.\n\n\n WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)\n\n      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to\n  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're\n  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're\n  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format\n  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special\n  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex\n  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure\n  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary\n  protocol.\n  \n         How a file has been translated and compressed for\n  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have\n  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was\n  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file\n  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the\n  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step\n  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary\n  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress\n  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table\n  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs\n  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh\n  files as they are downloaded.\n\n***************************************************************************\nSuffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar \nExtractors\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  \nCompact Pro|         X     X \nPackit     |                           X\nUUTool     |                                                      X \nMacCompress|                                X \nSunTar     |               X     X     X                                X \nBinHex 5.0 |                     X \nBinHex 4.0 |               X \nDiskDoubler|                           X                X \nUnZip      |                                                   X \nDiskCopy   |                                     X \nmacutil    |         X     X           X                X\n***************************************************************************\n\n     A few notes on the decompressors:\n\n      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different\n  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff\n  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,\n  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will\n  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. \n  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt\n  Expander. \n    \n         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller\n  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow\n  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep\n  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous\n  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.\n   \n         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX\n  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)\n  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac\n  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators\n  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also\n  available by anonymous ftp. \n  \n         Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to\n  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading\n  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the\n  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be\n  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress\n  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0\n  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an\n  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if\n  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of\n  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the\n  info-mac/unix directory.\n\n     A few notes on the compression formats:\n\n      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file\n  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. \n  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal\n  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications\n  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating\n  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance\n  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.\n  \n      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,\n  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be\n  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of\n  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve\n  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on\n  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. \n  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have\n  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.\n  \n      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above\n  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created\n  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be\n  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some\n  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard\n  designation for self-extracting archives created with their \n  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they \n  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.\n\n\n HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)\n\n      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human\n  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a\n  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to\n  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo\n  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,\n  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. \n  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.\n    \n         If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually\n  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer \n  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of \n  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of\n  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. \n  \n         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any \n  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that \n  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by \n  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and \n  login.  Type the word \"binary.\"  Hit return.  Type \"cd\n  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression\" and hit return.  Then\n  \"get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin\"  and hit return.  Of course\n  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt\n  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this\n  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto\n  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will\n  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If\n  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still\n  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make\n  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe\n  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last\n  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals\n  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.\n  \n  \n  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)\n\n       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable\n  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac\n  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.\n  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as\n  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may \n  terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement \n  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going \n  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  \n  (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send \n  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering\n  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world \n  of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question\n  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh\n  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a \n  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\nTROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)\n================================================================= \n\n         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific\n  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. \n  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking\n  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step\n  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,\n  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system\n  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your\n  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to\n  recommend solutions to you.\n\n IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)\n\n      \"Microsoft Word is crashing\" doesn't say much.  What were you\n  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the\n  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions\n  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. \n  The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions\n  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the\n  following steps fix the problem.  For example, \"Sometimes\n  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error.\" is\n  not nearly as helpful as \"QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two\n  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already\n  contain text.\"  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug\n  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the\n  problem and see if it's still there or not.\n\n\n READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)\n\n      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and\n  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the\n  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound\n  familiar.\n\n\n CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)\n\n      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus\n  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and\n  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  \n   \n       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,\n  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file\n  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This\n  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring\n  from original masters will normally fix this.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  \n\n      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file\n  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. \n  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean\n  reinstall. \n  \n         If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these\n  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your\n  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the\n  program.  So it's time to\n\n\n ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  \n \n         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem\n  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the\n  cause of a system or application crash:\n  \n     a.\tRun only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do\n     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself\n     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin\n     launching other applications until you find the one that causes \n     the crash.\n     \n     b.\tIf you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're\n     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you \n     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially \n     when performing complicated operations.\n     \n     c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit\n     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile\n     software out there including some from companies that really \n     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  \n     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its \n     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.\n     \n     d.\tBoot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears\n     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove\n     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense\n     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs\n     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the\n     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the\n     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,\n     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have\n     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the\n     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the\n     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the\n     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the\n     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make \n     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.\n\n\n CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)\n\n      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why\n  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the\n  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work\n  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the\n  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.\n\n    \n\n ====================== \n PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)\n ======================\n\n      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a\n  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot\n  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to\n  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's\n  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step\n  program should be performed about every three months. \n\n\n TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)\n\n      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more\n  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a\n  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,\n  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for\n  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've\n  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements\n  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no\n  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several\n  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty \n  the trash.\n\n\n RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)\n\n      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. \n  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension \n  in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an\n  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably\n  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes\n  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. \n  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no\n  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your\n  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. \n\n\n REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)\n\n      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary\n  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It\n  lets the system know what application should be launched when you\n  open a given file and what icons it should display where. \n  Depending on its size each application has one or more\n  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files\n  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become\n  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. \n  Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with\n  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than\n  to defeat an incumbent. \n  \n         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments\n  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice\n  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments\n  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only \n  if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed. \n  \n         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your\n  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. \n  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild\n  the desktop and warning you that \"This could take a few minutes.\" \n  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you\n  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may\n  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.\n   \n          If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing\n  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's\n  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the\n  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly\n  corrupt data structures.    \n\n\n ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)\n\n      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950\n  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain\n  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk\n  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this \"parameter\n  RAM\" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset\n  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys\n  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,\n  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the\n  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter\n  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General\n  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.\n   \n         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the \n  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is\n  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this\n  opportunity to reset it anyway.\n\n\n RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) \n\n      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most\n  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the\n  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these\n  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of\n  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough\n  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of\n  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,\n  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and\n  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this\n  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance\n  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.\n  \n         If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically\n  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6\n  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage\n  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set\n  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. \n  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot\n  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility\n  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks\n  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much\n  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,\n  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)\n\n      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if\n  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. \n  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file\n  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:\n\n    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  \n    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out \n        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.\n    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the \n        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple \n        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be \n        replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or \n        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, \n        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level \n        of the System Folder.\n    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder \n        is  fine.\n    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then \n        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your \n        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, \n        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't \n        need that waste your memory and disk space.\n    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the \n        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System \n        folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you \n        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace \n        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. \n    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.\n    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file \n        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable \n        system overall.\n\n\n     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)\n\n      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that\n  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even\n  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility\n  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System\n  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in\n  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier \n  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com\n  and run it on all your hard disks.\n     \n         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that\n  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid\n  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything\n  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general\n  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's\n  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh\n  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well\n  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. \n  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of\n  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features\n  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.\n   \n         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they\n  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and\n  reformat (4.9).\n\n\n     BACKING UP  (4.8)\n\n      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be\n  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back\n  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies\n  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate\n  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back\n  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three\n  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. \n  \n         A number of programs are available to make backing up\n  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with\n  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup\n  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder\n  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the\n  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup\n  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.\n  \n         Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network\n  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should\n  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,\n  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There\n  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD\n  Backup from System 6.  \n\n\n DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)\n\n      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free\n  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the\n  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be\n  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more\n  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several\n  ways to defragment a hard disk.\n  \n         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your\n  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while\n  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.\n   \n         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for\n  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.\n  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag\n  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the\n  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before\n  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO\n  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the\n  net by asking for one. \n\n\n REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)\n\n      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a\n  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't\n  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is\n  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means\n  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even\n  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are\n  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate\n  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3\n  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may\n  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator\n  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not\n  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.\n     \n         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to\n  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. \n  Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal\n  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. \n  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with\n  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat\n  your hard disk.\n  \n         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available\n  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like\n  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk\n  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the\n  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition\n  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware\n  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones\n  bundled with your hard disk. \n  \n         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and\n  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter\n  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and\n  data losses are a very good possibility.\n  \n\n\n  Elliotte Rusty Harold         Department of Mathematics\n  elharo@shiva.njit.edu         New Jersey Institute of Technology\n  erh0362@tesla.njit.edu        Newark, NJ 07102"

At one extreme was\na man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the\nproblem was that the 13\" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always\nkeep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from\na largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's\npower supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was\nreally wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that\nit had to be endured.)\n\nThis seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to\nadopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13\" monitor\nowner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the \nApple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading\nJitter Correction.

I love my portable system (got a color home setup\nalso. Mac II). Reasoning was that MATLAB programs at school and other\nsimulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours (or\novernight) to run, tying up my Mac II. I got the PB100 with fast modem\nto do light work and on-the-run stuff. I figured I'd give it to my\nlittle sister next year when she goes to college. It's running System\n7.1 now without any problems. Also I sometimes do DEC4015 terminal\nemulations with MATLAB on our university's VAX_VMS (nice thing that it\nbenchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac IIfx).\nSo, the PB100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (not\ntoo hard at all for it). It was a FABULOUS setup !!!!  :)  Weeee!!!\n\n(By the Way, all MATLAB software was on class accounts. I was also the\nTA for a class that used SIMULAB/SIMULINK.

Great Program!!! )\n\nJust like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost never\nget enuff memory.... Buy it while it's cheap - that is buy it when you\nget the computer since it's usually cheaper than upgrading... I ALWAYS\nrun out of disk space... But I have a syquest on the Mac IIsi, so I\nnever worried about space before... Got several carts).\n\n-shishin \"squish\" yamada\nsquish@endor.harvard.edu"

I love the Mac interface and any number\nof the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed.

I was doing continuous background sound with\ninterrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V\ndocumentation.\n\nYou probably were cancelling your callback commands out of\nyour channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if\nyou have problems with sounds working when you play one per\nchannel and then close the channel (with the related\nslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't\nwork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a\nchannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\nchannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you\nwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you\nare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.\n\nNow before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the\nsound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses\nit. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you\ncan too.\n\nOne little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the\nSound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not\nsure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your\nsounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the\nSound Manager.\n\n-Steve"

Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted\nabove the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take\npictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit\ndigital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,\nthe camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,\nwith 256 gray levels, on the screen.\n\nUsers will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record\ndetail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera\nis expected to cost between $150 and $250.\n\nThe systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's\nCasper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have\nto purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.\n\nThe two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility\ncalled the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by\napplications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.\n\nThe Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support\nfor up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an\nFPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will\nrequire a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.\nUsers will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the\nCyclone's.\n\nFor more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek."

        "content": "REPOST - DUE TO NET PROBLEMS\n\nHi,\n   I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROM\nrevision 376. I had reports that this Mac was having trouble \nformatting disks and by the time I got to it, the FDHD just would\nnot respond although all other functions were fine.\n\nI checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin\n6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. The power \nsupply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair.\n\nWith the power supply reinstalled, I now get the following error:\n\nWith the internal FDHD connected, the Mac boots fine but on completion\nof boot cycle an alert displays \"The disk is unreadable - do you\nwant to eject it?\". For every combination of response, the alert \nreappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. The\nFDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable\nof ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whether\nthere is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external \nconnector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.\n\nWith the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great \n(MacEKG reports no errors). The DB19 external connector now shows\nno voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.\n\nNow, the internal FDHD may be fubar, but I have an apple 800K external\ndrive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when\nconnected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16\n(after suitable surgery to the external drive). The voltages at J16 \n(with the internal FDHD disconnected) are as follows:\n\n\tPIN\tVolts\tPIN\tVolts\n\t1\t-\t2\t5\n\t3\t-\t4\t5\n\t5\t-\t6\t5\n\t7\t-\t8\t-\n\t9\t-\t10\t5\n\t11\t-\t12\t-\n\t13\t10.75\t14\t5\n\t15\t10.75\t16\t5\n\t17\t10.75\t18\t-\n\t19\t10.75\t20\t5\n\nThis machine has a SWIM which I don't think EKG tests.

You turn on\nyour computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it\ncools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles\nof this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics\nare much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact\nportable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function\nthat extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal\ncycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my\ncomputer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it\noff (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the\nphosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in\nthe computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue\nlife of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular\narchitecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :\") \n\nCharles Kuehmann\nNorthwestern University\nSteel Research Group"

True,\nthere is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but\nthe internal power supply is well-protected. (I've turned my Mac on and off \nsix or seven times a day for three years without problem).  The monitor is\nthe same.

        "subject": "Quadra Clock Modification - Long",
        "content": "Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed. Previously I\nhad been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU\nbut this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.\n\nYour mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted\nbefore hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.\nI didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher\nspeeds.\n\nParts\n\n\tClock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of\n\tspeeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the\n\toscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend\n\tgetting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.\n\n\t   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for\n\t   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:\n\n\t\t   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)\n\t\t   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)\n\t\t   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)\n\n\t   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.\n\n\t   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a\n\t   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)\n\t   \n\tSocket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as\n\t   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins\n\t   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.\n\n\tCooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a \n\t   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had\n\t   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which\n\t   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up \n\t   something similar or risk frying your CPU.\n\t   \nProcedure\n\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.\n\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from\n\tthe back of the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic\n    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,\n\trear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.\n\t\n9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to\n    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.\n\t\n10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of\n    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic\n\tPower light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The\n\tmotherboard then comes directly out.\n\t\n11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the\n    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators\n\tmust be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.\n\t\n\tVery carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of\n\tthe pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure\n\tyour desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.\n\t\n\tI used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is\n\tNOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is\n\ta multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without\n\tproper care.\n\t\n12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.\n\n13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the\n\told clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the\n\tsocket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new\n\t50 mhz clock.\n\t\n14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.\n\t\n14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.\n\n15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother\n    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.\n\t\n16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n18) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.\n\n21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn \n    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,\n\tsomething is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your\n\thandiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.\n\t\n\tHopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and\n\treplace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and\n\tbe astounded. \n\t\n\tYou will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding\n\ta particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up\n\tmight take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since\n\tmodifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single\n\tproblem.\n\t\nGood Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real\nrisk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than\n$50 in parts.\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>"

I have attempted to gather as many case histories as\npossible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies\nprobably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that\nsuccess rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24\nmachines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.\nThis is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.\n\nThanks to all who contributed to this poll. \n\n\nIssues:\n\n\tSpeed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without\n\t\tadd on cards. All reported machines were able to use\n\t\t25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple\n\t\tNubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter\n\t\twas able to go faster than 25 mhz.

Hence,\n\t\t\tthe 25 mhz operational machines may well work at\n\t\t\thigher speeds.\n\t\t\t\n\tDamage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad.

(Is this a \"sell\" on screen saver software companies?)\n\nGoals for \"idle\" power consumption have been set at something like 30\nwatts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on\nthis).\n\nNote that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,\nespecially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.\nSun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for\nthe night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per\nyear.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would\nprobably have greater than double that value.\n\nGiven that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and\nhome computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),\nbuilding power consumption control into all machines has a potential to\ncut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard.\n\nBTW: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving\nwork, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors\nwith the power switch on front.  There was some indication that\nmonitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate\nlots of power cycling.  This may only apply to the monitors we use, but\nmight be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch\nin back."

Does this limit my choices of video cards?\n\nThanks\n--\nPeace.\n                \"Fighting for peace is like f*cking for virginity.\" \n                                   -\\--/-\n    Don't just adopt opinions     |  \\/  |       Some of you are homeboys\n          develop them.           |  /\\  | but only I am The Homeboy From hell\n                                   -/--\\-"

The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSI\nchip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2\nmodes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI\nperformance over the Q900.

Reynolds\" <jpr1@lehigh.edu>\nSubject: When you're not using it, turn it off!\nDate: Mon, 22 Mar 1993 06:50:14 GMT\nLines: 53\n\nResearch has shown that the majority of the time that the United\nStates' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on, they are not\nactively being used.  In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running\nat night and on weekends.\n\nComputer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use\nof electricity.  Computers alone are believed to account for five\npercent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for\nten percent by the year 2000.\n\nIf you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it\nwould be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF\nwhen you're not using it.  It only takes a second or two to do.\n\nAlso, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed\nby the computer itself, but by the monitor.  If you can't turn the\ncomputer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance\nwith computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy-\nefficient PCs that \"power down\" automatically when not being used\nand thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation.  These\nnew computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and\nNew Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual\nelectricity bills.  Look for the special EPA \"Energy Star\" logo when\nyou buy computers.  They should be available in one to two years.\n\nAccording to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2\nemissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million\nautomobiles.  Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen\noxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants\nresponsible for acid rain.\n\nPlease do your part ... be responsible.  If you're not using it,\nthen just TURN IT OFF.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nInformation herein is partially taken from the 1993 \"Information\nPlease\" Almanac, page 573, and the U.S. Envirnomental Protection\nAgency's \"Environmental News.\"\n\nPlease redistribute this message to every computer bulletin board,\nnetwork, memo system, etc. you can think of.

You can use any\nold vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a\nMac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two\nmachines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a\nthree row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.\n\n    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.\n The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400\nresolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above\nadaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my\n1604s).\n\nTHen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would\nadvocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As\nto the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because\nthey will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.\n    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN\nCONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU\nTO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND\nTHEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.\n\npersonal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers\ndoesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to\nfind out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the\nsync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits\n(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most\nfavorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a\nspecialized application video card).(i.e. \"well you can get a resolution\n1168x832 on this $5,  9\" \"super smelly sock\" monitor that will let you\ndisplay TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably\npriced \"oder eater\" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an\nultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz\nvertical.\")\n\n\n\nNote:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video\nboard using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the\nsides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as\npossible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an\ninch.\n\n                                                                    -A."

What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time\nthe video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the\nMac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video\ncircuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,\neven pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's\npretty hard to hit menu items ;-)\nWe had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem\nhas been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has\nvaried. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the\ncache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not\nobviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU\nright?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did\nnot keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have\nhas this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,\nbut did it twice within an hour yesterday).\nThe technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty\nsharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had\npreviously tried ourselves anyway).

You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing\npower cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the\ncomputer.\n\nBoth cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer\nstores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at\ngood prices).

Remember when the si came out and everyone complained\nabout it's power supply.  This is one result of apple providing a low-cost\ncomputer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end\ncomputer (at the time anyways) that couldn't even support their own video\nboard.  Even if this isn't what is causing your problems, you might develop\none later.\n\nEric"

Its just  \nthat the newer CD ROM drives have both capability.  Multisession means that  \nwhen you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session, the drive can  \nread and display them.

This means that you lose the ability to add  \nany more pictures after the first time (must buy a new CD).  Finally, since the  \nCD150 is not a double speed drive, it will require twice as long to transfer  \ndata (excluding sound).\n\n> Michael M.

Some companies selling such drives are: Spin Peripherals (a\nbargain at $499) and PLI (a company I hate) and Relax Technologies\n(a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime\nplayer in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign). The NEC\nCDR74 is also a good choice (NEC's own mechanism, I think). ClubMac\nsells it for around $619.\n\n>Thanx.\n\nYour welcome, ooh but now I see your from Germany. Most of the\nmailorder info does you little good, I guess.

The Toshiba's speed\nadvantage is very slight: 20% in average access time (a minor plus)\nand 10% in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).\n\nGood luck,\nMark"

I haven't heard of any problems.  Sounds\nto me like your dealer doesn't know what he's talking about.  It's\npretty irresponsible to not reccomend the Centris 610 on the basis\nof problems with one machine.  Recommending the IIvx over the LCIII\ndoesn't make a lot of sense either.

The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the\nCD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless\nyou get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.\n\n  You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just faster\nreading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD,\nbut only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.\n\nPaul"

The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close\nto the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so\nmuch a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.\nWhy else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business\napplication. \n\nWhat do you mean by 'no \"retail price\"'.  Quite the contrary, I think.\nThe price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,\nIMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling\nrequired.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One\nprice, medium performance, ready to go.\n\nWhen I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears\n(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and\nBizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the\nother was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who\nwent the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who\nsells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I\nsuspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know\ndidly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any\nof the  Apple dealers I spoke with...\n\nIf you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from\nMontgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.\nI'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple\nPerforma Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with that\ndecision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out\nwith a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.  \n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstrument Approach Procedures Automation             DOT/FAA/AMI-230\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBryan D.

        "content": "Interesting delema for all those out there.\nMy school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio\n100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections.  (no joke)  Here is the\ndeal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a\ndisection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehow\ndrawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know\nNADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I\nwnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing\nlist?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms.\nOk here it goes:\n\n\tWe are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms\noffered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price\nand reliability, the second being VERY important.\n\tHow much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you\nthink?\n\tOk, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard\n(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time\ngreat wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is\njust a reliable?  Price?\n\tPrinters:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the\nThermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit\naccess so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in\nterms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) \nPrice? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or\nsuch to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is\nthe Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. \nSuggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through\nand they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy\nto maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).\n\tFinally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting\nthese things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the\nnet, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to be\nastronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask\nthem?\n\tLittle more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot\nabout macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have the\ntime to go and look for all of this stuff. So I am hoping the collective\nresources and intelect of the net can help (Has before) [Shameless plug: BUY\nEMPOWER!!!

However...\n\n(2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal\nthe Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch \"high resolution color\ndisplay\"---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode.\n\nSo, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you\nneed (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the\nVGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use\nit's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor\nthat can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over\nthe VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot\nproduce).\n\nAs far as (a) above is concerned, contact\n\n James Engineering, Inc.\n 6329 Fairmount Ave.\n El Cerrito, CA  94530\n 510-525-7350\n FAX: 510-525-5740\n\nThey can probably get you the right adapter.  Remember: you do *not*\nwant the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to\nhave your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer\nwill just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want\nan adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style\nconnectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry\nfor the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.\n\nAs far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal\nwith a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of\n67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison,\nthe VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and\na 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.\n\nThe monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as\nthe Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes\nin the PC compatible world.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\t-Fred Martin\n\n\n-- \nFred Martin | fredm@media.mit.edu | (617) 253-7143 | 20 Ames St. Rm.

When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M\nharddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space \nwould cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-\nuartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and \nyou will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  \n\nParticularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a\nseveral-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files \nwith DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like \nos, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are \npricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much\nit would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a \nuseful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though\nI must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my \ncomputer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to \nbecause I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, \nsoftPC or trying any unix os!)\n\n-Peter\nbell@minerva.cis.yale.edu"

I bought the APS Quantum 240 zero\nfootprint drive in May '92 (back when they still used two separate LEDs on the\nfront panel and the case was metal).  While traveling with it (it was in my\nSE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs\nholding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel\nwas coming forward away from the rest of the drive.  I lived with this situation\nuntil it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a\nnetwork shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me\nsome dead time during which to have the drive sent out).\n\nI called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the\ntab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers --\nthough nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my\nmodem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm\nnever flying with my SE/30 again).  And when I called back to ask whether I\ncould send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem\nwith that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a\nday (they're usually good for 10 days).  The front panel was replaced under\nwarranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class\ninsured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed\nEx by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was\ntraveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]).\n\nThe only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked\nto, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the\ndrive mechanism out and send just the case.  Unfortunately, I discovered the\nday I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little\nseal and thus voiding the warranty!  Oh, well.\n\nAl\nalbert@seas.ucla.edu"

The problem: Someone in our lab  \nhas an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an  \naftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics \"SIMMer\").  the DB25 SCSI plug runs  \nthrough the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin  \nrectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,  \nto put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the  \n26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside  \ndown, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he  \ncould try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools  \nthat we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.  Now,  \nnone of the computers in our lab will recognize it.  We tried Disk Doctor, and  \nit doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain.

If it's the latter, then they\nwon't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,\nthere aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime\nmovies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and\ntransferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't\nmatter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.\n\nI remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,\nand that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.

        "content": "Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for\n$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\n5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\n\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see\nthe drive there's a definite hardware problem.\n\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\n\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\nrecovery.)\n\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \n\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\nBut c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\na letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even \nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\n\nWhat's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any\nother products from La Cie in the future.\n\nBill Krauthammer\nf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\n\nPS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service\nhas been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like\nthat. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and\nI'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future."

I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called\n8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression\nfrom the cpu to the AM29000 on the card. So it seems it can be done even though\nin a developer article it states that the GC can't be programmed - but they\nasked that any suggestions be sent in anyway...\n\nSteve Margelis\nMelbourne University"

I must say that the connections between the power supply\nand the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be\nbadly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the\nlast\nphase (lower Voltage).\n\nSo you can do following if you are used to such technical terms.\n1) Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray\n2) readjust the 5 Volt level of your powersupply\n3) use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowinÔ through the floppy!\n   (a fixed piece of paper can prevent this)\nif you don't know how to do it beg a friendly technician!\n\nChristian Bauer\n\nbauer@informatik.uni-ulm.de"

The only reason\nto get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep \nin mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.\nThis lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards.

Some new\ndrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data\nwrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform\na test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical\ntolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*\ntrack drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This\nbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and\nso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it\nseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of\nboosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.\n\nI first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed\nout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when\ndigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers\nexplicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT\nto be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nVictor"

This week's MacWeek\nreports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.

I would have rather waited for one of the new\nmachines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my\nIIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me\nto purchase now.

If you wait\nuntil the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as\nwell wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and\nthen the units which follow them.  You may save some money but\nyou've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the\ncomputer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous\nstate of flux.

It has an access of 200ms and a data\ntransfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is\navailable from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two\nmail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since\nI've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped\nto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The\nCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,\nwhich supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to\nattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the\nCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly\nlower price with two free CDs.\n\nThe Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I\nthink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the\nthree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple\ncatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo\ncd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of\nwhich are pretty good.\n\nThe NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and\na data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around\n$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible\nbefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of\nthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's\nunless you buy it in a bundle.\n\nOf the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the\nApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's\ncompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's\nspeed and performance. \n\nBTW, the models of the drives are:\n\nApple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)\n\nCD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it\nis also something like with 3401)\n\nNEC:  CDR-74\n\n\nI'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems\nwhatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am\npretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.\n\nAlso, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as\nthe president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,\nmy hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is\njust a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the\nenormous chinese community.

(6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.

So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\naccess data at the same time.)\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n--David\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| David Blume            | \"I get tired thinking of all the things I  |\n| dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don't want to do.\"  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+"

(Sorry for length).\n\nTo increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed\nfrom 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.\nThis is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some\naluminum foil down to work on.\n\t1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.\n\t2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,\n\t\tspreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.\n\t3. Remove the flopy drive.\n\t4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting\n\t\tthe supply straight up and out.\n\t5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom\n\t\tside of the fan and lifting straight up and out.\n\t6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and\n\t\tright side of the board and sliding the board forward then\n\t\tlifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the\n\t\tboard must be removed first)\n\t7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).\n\t\tThis is not easy even for a skilled solderer.\n\t8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins\n\t\tby pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.\n\t9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder \n\t\tthem in.\n\t10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.\n\t11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and \n\t\tthe other large chip just to the right of the processor and\n\t\tfigure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a\n\t\tsimple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole\n\t\tin the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using\n\t\tinsulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat\n\t\tsync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.\n\n\t12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.\n\nDisclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.\n\t    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will\n\t    void your warentee.\n\nBye for now,\n************************************************\nRalph Durtschi    (208) 236-3256\nIdaho State University\nEMAIL:  durtralp@ux1.isu.edu\n************************************************"

The critical information from the neuron is in\nthe firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per\nseconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the\nsignal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit\nconvertor is more then sufficient.\n\nAC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases\nyou are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled\nalso. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If\nthe cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly\ndistorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the\noccurrence of the spike that is important. \n\nHowever, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start\nbattling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue were\nto start looking for the technical specifications.\n\nPeter.  \nroes@vax.oxford.ac.uk"

Since they aren't fixed in position on their\nstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different\nposition. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of\ncontact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing\nthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the\nball, not the center cylindrical area.\n\nI've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but\nneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our\noffice's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one\ncould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might\nhelp.\n\nI would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If\nyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl \nalcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.\n\nIf you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see\nif it is actually causing the axle to spin. \n\nIf all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(\nIt could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be\nnecessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that\ndirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nMurray\n \n\n-- \nMurray M.

Gurman) writes:\n>    The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only\n>(can't say for certain about the Models 125 and 133), so your best bet\n\nThat's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\nof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered\nDESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used\nwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.\n\nMy advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:\n\n(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add\n    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\n    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\n\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\n      self-terminated or not.\n    - configure MacTCP to use \"Ethernet\".\n\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\n      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable\n      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).\n    - get a 25ohm terminator.\n\nYour two-machine network will look like this:\n\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                           |\n      +-----+                                         +-----+\n                                                      |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n     5000/200                                           650\n                              OR\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n        {=}                                             |\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                         +-----+\n      +-----+                                         |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n5000/25,125,133,240                                     650\n         \n   ##    -> 25ohm terminator\n   T     -> T connector\n   ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)\n   {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter\n   []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)\n   |\n   |\n\nAndy\n-- \nAndy Sun (andy@ie.utoronto.ca)          4 Taddle Creek Road, Toronto\nComputing Coordinator                   Ontario, Canada.

That's all handled by the\nchip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the\nclock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt\nsynchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.\n\nFurthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra.\nOn Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the\nMac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind\nmode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.  On the 5396, the\nhandshake is entirely handled by the chip.\n\n--Tim Smith"

Where do I connect this switch??

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\"\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\n\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\naccelerator.\n\nPaul"

        "content": "------ X-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers -------\n\nYou've heard about Apple's great new customer \"support\" program.  Well,\nthink again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple\ncomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:\n\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \"stick\" in\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\nBCGA65431. You'll recognize this \"sticky button\" symptom immediately if you\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.\n\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \nsuggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\nit worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\n\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\n\nIf the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\nthe details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.\n\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to\nme or post yet another \"sticky-button\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\nwill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy\nto stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the\nnext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.\n\n-- Bill Sloan"

        "content": "Hello all!\n\nFor few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D\n(predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac\nIIvi.\n\nWith a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra\nvideo) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not\nto prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.\n\nBut because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating\nApple 13\" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local\ndistributor of NEC.\nWith both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of\nthe time or every now and then.\nBut with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows\netc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts\nsideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some\n\"spiky\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing\npull-downs etc.\nWith the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only\nsense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a\npicture clear enough to shut down from menu...\nWith the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but\nsometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely\nlost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.\n\nI know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but\nwith the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?\n\nI'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can,\nat least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin\nassignment for NEC 3D.\nI am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and\nisolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be\narranged, especially syncs and groundings.\n\nYes, I have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works\nperfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and\nalso Atari 71Hz monochrome, which I am using now with it.\n\nHere are the pinouts & stuff:\n\n15 pin mini D-sub (NEC 3D)\t\t15 pin D-sub (Mac, at least Quadra)\n\n1  Red Video\t\t\t\t1  Red GND\n2  Green Video\t\t\t\t2  Red Video\n3  Blue Video\t\t\t\t3  Composite Sync\n4  GND\t\t\t\t\t4  Sense 0\n5  GND\t\t\t\t\t5  Green Video\n6  Red GND\t\t\t\t6  Green GND\n7  Green GND\t\t\t\t7  Sense 1\n8  Blue GND\t\t\t\t8  NC\n9  NC\t\t\t\t\t9  Blue Video\n10 GND\t\t\t\t\t10 Sense 2\n11 GND\t\t\t\t\t11 C.Sync & V.Sync GND\n12 NC\t\t\t\t\t12 V.Sync\n13 H.Sync\t\t\t\t13 Blue GND\n14 V.Sync\t\t\t\t14 H.Sync GND\n15 NC\t\t\t\t\t15 H.Sync\nSHELL GND\t\t\t\tSHELL GND\n\n\n\nConnection suggested by Apple for VGA/SVGA, sense pins changed to\nemulate Apple 13\" with Multisync (my self-made adapter)\n\nMultisync (15pin mini D-sub)\tMac (15pin D-sub)\n\t  \n\t  1  ---------------------- 2\n\t  2  ---------------------- 5\n\t  3  ---------------------- 9\n\t  6  ---------------------- 1\n\t  7  ---------------------- 6\n\t  8  ---------------------- 13\n\t  10 ---------------------- 14\n\t  13 ---------------------- 15\n\t  14 ---------------------- 12\n\t\t\t\t    4 (sense0) grounded to 11 (sync GND)\n\n\nConnection measured from an adapter to make NEC 3FG/4FG \nemulate Apple 13\" (adapter provided by NEC representative)\n\n\tNEC (15 mini)   \tMac (15)\n\n\t1   ----------------------- 2\n\t2   ----------------------- 5\n\t3   ----------------------- 9\n\t4   ----------------------- SHELL GND, 1, 4, 6, 13\n\t5   ----------------------- same as above\n\t6   ----------------------- same...\n\t7   ----------------------- same...\n\t8   ----------------------- same...\n\t10  ----------------------- same...\n\t11  ----------------------- same...\n\t13  ----------------------- 3\n\t14    * Not Connected! *\n\t\n\nWell, I am waiting for your solutions...\n\nAnd thanks!\n\n--\nJartsu"

This\nis definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the\nstock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI \naccelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,\nNew Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.\n\nI added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive\ntower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto\nwhich I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally\nterminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems\noccur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two\ninternal hard drives.\n\nIt works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same."

Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,\nI'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one\nscreen.\n \nI'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within\ndriving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you\ndon't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes\nfor the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service\nin the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and\nflip it in your direction.\n \nDetails:\n \nMirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:\n---------------------------------------------------\n \n**SOLD**\n \nSony 1304 14\" color monitor:\n----------------------------\nWhat's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,\nTrinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).\nIt's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,\nand although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.\n \nStill selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not\nincluding shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an\noffer if that sounds unreasonable.\n \n \nRasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nRenamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13\"\nmonitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode\n(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output\nNTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a\nRAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg\nSIMMS).\n \nSelling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking\n**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and\npackaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card\ntogether, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a \"bundled offer\"\nfor these items.\n \n------------\n \nCheers. \n\ndan keldsen - djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu\n\n-- \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been:\ndjk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  a.

PDS (processor direct slot) is just that:\nhere are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with\nthis and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You\nmay be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2\nvideo cards in, and just watch them conflict!

The relevant parts are:\n\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25\" device mounting bracket]\n\nNote Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\nmount a 5.25\" device.  The service techs I talked to said, \"Oh sure,\nwe stock those.\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\ncut out for a standard 5.25\" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\n5.25\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.\n\nI'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25\" device.\n\nGood luck with your SyQuest.\n\n\t-Fred"

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\n\n\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\n\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\n\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\n--  \n=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=\n Eric Choi - Internet: Eric.Choi@p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org"

New experimental processors have 64-bit data pathways and can\nschedule up to 8 out of 32 instructions each clock cycle.  That sort\nof trick can't really be done with CISC architectures.\n\nI finally saw some details on the 586/Pentium and was not greatly\nimpressed.  They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to\nspeed, but otherwise it's only going to be a 2x speedup.  And to get\nthat they're using two integer units, larger caches, and a branch\ntarget buffer.  Yes, I know they're talking about 100MHz processors.\nBig whoop.

As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory\nsystem becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If\nyou have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory\nevery 20ns.

This disables the auto-answer \nfunction of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra\n14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.\n\nIn Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.

The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:\n\nA/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to\n200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed\ninputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the\nsame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate\nmust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits\nat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national\nInstruments, at the same sample rate.\n\nD/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of\nthe 4 output channels has its own converter.\n\nThe price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface\nboard (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP's is $2695.

Advice from a grad student.\n\n\tI agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.\nThe important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and \nlearn as much as possible about it.  \n\n\tIn my five years of education in this field, though brief \ncompare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of \nquestion a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into\nElectrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or\nCS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this\nkind of question is irrelevant.  \n \n\tI have come to believe that choosing CS because one \ndoes not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does\nnot like to program is really doing an injustice of building\nand computer and making it useful for something.  Everything\nis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a \npart of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.\n\n\tMy advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision\nbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to \nlearn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your \npersective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to\nexplore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the\nschool would make a student choose a major before her/his\nsophamore year.                  \n\n\tHey you may be so interested in this field that you \ndecided to learn all about the making of computers in which \ncase, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.\n\n\tAbout the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you\nare good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. \nIf you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  \nLike wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.        \n\n- Chung Yang"

        "content": "This is turning into a FAQ\n\n\nHere is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own\nmemory.\n\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer here\n \n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\n\tof the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\n\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\n\t\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\n\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\n\t\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>"

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and\nstarted to experience these problems.\n\nApple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of\npotential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware\n(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power\nmanager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.\n\nNone of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe\n(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I\nhave no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears\nto help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on\nstartup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is\nbeing corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any\nnon-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be\nreset by \"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\" -\nApple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button\nI'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if\nsomeone can decipher Apple's advice for me.\n\nBeyond this Apple suggest that \" you should follow the technical\nprocedures to check the hardware of this Duo\". Since so many others\nappear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there\nhas been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line -\nand quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230\npurchasers who have this problem.\n\nAny more comments from others in the same boat are welcome,\nparticularly Apple Duo engineers :-)\n\ncheers\n\nbrucet\n\n-- \n          bruce tulloch sydney australia - brucet@extro.ucc.su.oz.au\n***complex problems have straight forward, easy to understand wrong answers***"

I installed the\nnewest drivers from Asante's ftp server.\n\nThe problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -\nspecifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac\ntests memory, etc. Just before the \"happy Mac face\" normally shows up, the\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\n\nIt doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has\n*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had\nit for over a year).\n\nHere is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --\nseveral permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the\nhead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator\n(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal\nresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another\nidentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.\n\nHas anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?\nThanks a lot.

A funny one I\nnoticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD\ncapability refer to the \"auto inkjet\" feature. This should have read \"auto\ninject\" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen from\nApple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess\nthat someone edited the copy, saw \"inject\" and thought it was a typo and\nchanged it to the more familiar word \"inkjet\".\n\nHmmm, what would that be?

It would have the plus of RocketShare and\nthe minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,\nNuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.\n\nApple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except\nperhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC\nslot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC\naccelerators.\n\nOne potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will\nneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with\nRocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.\n\nApple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs\nwill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC\nand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in\nexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking\nprices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen\nmuch cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.\n\nFirst generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed\nCPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.\nThis should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled\nfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which\nI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do\nthis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as\nstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where\nApple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup\nis in order.\n\nBy the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,\nPentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor\nfront for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.\nAlso, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all\nthe other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent\nright now.\n\nOnce anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market\nposition will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially\nif AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it\nmight). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome\nbattle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not\nguaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of\nseveral.\n\nMark"

        "content": "Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the \nPowerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers:\n(1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes\n(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 \nrunning at 15.87 Mhz.\n(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a \nlot of memory.\n(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors \nthat still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors \nsell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell \nmemory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most \nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \nthe Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine \nCalifornia is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - \n$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that \nare selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.\n(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an \naverage access time of about 25 ms.\n(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a \nbacklit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move \nyour head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or \nnon-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.\n\nOther things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay \nfor it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to \nsell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about \n$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for \nabout $900. \n\nThe answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.\n\nI'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got \none they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright\n\n--\n  gene@theporch.raider.net (Gene Wright)\ntheporch.raider.net  615/297-7951 The MacInteresteds of Nashville"

In fact Apple has included in the ROMs\nof those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full\n040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching\nchips.

I think\nwe'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is\nno \"option\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:\nthere is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full\n'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).\nAnd there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other\nthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one\nof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be\ngetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't\nbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.\nIt's not an \"option.\"\n    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s\nthinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot\nrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for\na FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or\nsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to\nreplace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not\nneed to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the\nfull '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.\n\n-Hades"

Some\n>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel\n>(the first is preferrable, of course)\n\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\n\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\nbecause\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\nscanning\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\nsome machines).\n\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\nonce\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\nwant to\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\nthe\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\nof\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\nwant\nto make stereo sound.\n\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\nthe\nIBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\n\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\nhardware,\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\nworks.\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\n700/900/950\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\nonly.\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\nspecification,\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\n\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\n\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\nmachine\nyou have.\n\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\n>Lemmings\n>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\n>Glider 4.0\n>OIDS\nand also\nHellcats,\nSuper Tetris\nOxyd\n(and many more, these are just what I've tested)\n\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\n\n\nOther games you list:\n>Armor Alley\n>Spectre\n>Spaceward Ho!\nand also\nPGA Tour Golf\nCivilization\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\n\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\n\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\ndo,\nbut I'm going say it anyway.\nStop cheating on sound!\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\nis about to end.\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\nwork\neven better soon, so use it.\n\nIn conclusion:\nTo Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\nTo Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\nsound\nto both channels.

Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and\nothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations\ncannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be\ndisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2\nboxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be\ndisabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \"experts\".\n\nMy experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they\nmust have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.

The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n\"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity.\"\n                                                     - Frank Leahy"

All present Macs support the use of \n32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw \nallows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-\nbit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y \nindependently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 \ndpi [12\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including \nautosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz \nvertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser \nAug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and \nIIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit \ncolor (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  \nTo keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display \ncapability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit \ncolor.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX \nwill change this.\nIn addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one \nmonitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same \nthing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree \nof overlap of the pictures.\nVRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of \n built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit\n color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. \nSound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.

In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a \nstandard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is \nactually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like \nMac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, \nespecially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present \nthings are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver \nand monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, \nand monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with \nan IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \n the most commonly used.

Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting \n factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: \n 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a \n 64K \"window\", etc.\nOther non-SVGA standards: \n8514/a:\n IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions \n like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations \n from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do \n not have interlacing. \nTMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some\n do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.\nXGA:  eXtended Graphics Array\n newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones \n are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at \n 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.\nXGA-2\n Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in\n Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area\n fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-\n exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be \n far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth \n isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other \n companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh \n rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual \n discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.\n*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.\n\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software\n drivers.  \"Fast SCSI-1\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode\n {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are\n 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and\n 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \"fast SCSI-1\". \n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\n\nMac\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \n size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting \n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  \n Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: \n 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \n through put down.\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet \n to DMA.\nNuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:\n ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\" instead of the \n old 12\".\nQuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's \n VLBus - \"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\" (Byte 10/92:128).\n Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.\nCPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  \n Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at \n the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to \n dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each \n NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with \n 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.\n\nIBM\nMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-\nlike SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.\n\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: \nMFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited\n only used with smaller [² 60mb] hard drives.\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. \nESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface\n ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in\n many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of\n hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. \n\nBUS interfaces\n{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working \nwith old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}\nISA\n 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a\n 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).\n 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,\n hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards\n aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}\n while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's\n showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit\n (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  \nMCA {Micro Channel}\n IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\" \n (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components \n involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA \n and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).\nEISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}\n 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to \n self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable \n interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.\nVESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}\n Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}\n 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus \n mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for \n video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of\n their patents (Mel Martinez).\nQuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture\n (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines\n (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.\nPCI\n Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace \n ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.\n\nOSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]\nand multiple application use.}\nMac\n512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows \nApple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, \nmenu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require \nclone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires \naccess to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM \nchips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support \ninterface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS \nhas the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and \ntherefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control \nover hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with \nsome of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a \ntotally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon \nWtte).\n6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, \n cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  \n Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program \n interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of \n AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a \n 24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as \n real RAM is below 8MB.\n6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.\n6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.\n7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard \n to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present \n non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on\n system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking \n within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing \n can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be \n accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, \n Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable \n IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType \n support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present \n machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is \n both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit \n mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last \n 'free' OS.\n7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than \n 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode \n on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. \n Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades\n {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.\n [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system \n fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any \n RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all \n fonts from the system file.]\nA/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and \n a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS \n is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac \n ROMs.  Price: $709.\nNote: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats \nincluding the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and \nDCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' \nand AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most \nstill play.\n\nIBM\n Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for \nprogrammers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  \nSince hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, \nwhat little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  \nThis results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or \nEPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to \nbetter optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which \nis harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it \nreduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware \nsupport is needed.\nSide note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing \nall feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing \nits Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\"Undocumented Windows\") and \n\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to \nabort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 \n#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC \njudicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no \naction.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of \nchoosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has \nturned down Microsoft's copyright of \"Windows\" which would allow it to charge \na fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).\nMicroSoft OSes\nDOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier \n with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program \n must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS \n Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit \n Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in\n DOS 4.0.\nDOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk \n defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for \n networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} \n (Byte April 1993:44-46).\nDOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).\nWindow 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to \n deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to\n run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the\n equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].\n This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac\n programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and\n still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed\n is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).\n Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS\n counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).\nWindow 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base \n requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. \n Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).\nWindows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  \n Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 \n with built-in peer to peer networking support.\nWindows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the \n swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in \n the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the \n reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM \n but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).\n This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric \n multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in\n networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even\n though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor\n is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993\n (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993\n (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495\n (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).\nOther OSes\nPC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS \n 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).\nDR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} \n and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later \n version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple \n file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).\nOS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,\n 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, \n multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file \n to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. \n IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this \n (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).\nAIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.\nNeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final \n version to be out by May 25, 1993.\nSolaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric \n multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with \n tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and \n communication package.

Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.\nMac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel \n Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM \n (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run \n on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps \n will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to \n Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow \n progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in \n late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}\n\nPowerPC\nRumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; \nMacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA \nvideo (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week \n3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.\nApple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and \nto have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to \nsale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser \n9/92:146)}\n(MacWeek 3/22/93).\nPowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on\n PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain\n (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard\n drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.\n Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.\nPink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92) \n and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and \n PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).\nWindows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.\nSolaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the\n Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state \n that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details\nNeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.\n\nOS Number Crunching (Mel Park)\nMac\n Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard \nApple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an \nFPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or \ntaking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are \nhandled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal \nrepresentation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment \nof 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and \nthe FPU programmed directly.\n\nIBM\n Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when \nemulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever \ncompiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers \nexceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS \nprompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this \nbetter.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, \nWindows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.\n\nNetworking [Includes printing]\nWYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially \nif one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.\nMac\nHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  \nLocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for \neach machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to \ninclude very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in \nEthernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at \nabout $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and \ntransceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.\nThe Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet \ninterface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a \nnetwork option since 1989.\nSoftware: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can \nuse variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS \nas well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, \nBanyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing \nmachines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows \ntypical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version \nwill have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 \n(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC \nPathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software \nbuilt-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. \nPrinting requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in \nthe chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the \nchooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.\nPrinting bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.\n {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}\n\nIBM  \nHardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.\nSoftware: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk \nprotocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.\nEach of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible \nwith the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to \nthat product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more \nforgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, \n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more \ncomplex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac \nfinder and file management system by Novell.

Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly \n implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one \n software program to the next.\nWindows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \"jobs\" \n in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \"active\"... even if they \n are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers \n on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine \n which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like \n and intelligent about this.\nOS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.\nPrinting bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do \nnot have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and \nnot that of the OS involved.\n\nPrice issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features \nthan IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars \nby both worlds.\nThe IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware \nstandarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to \nhandle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac \nhardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  \nbuilt-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and \nNuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent \nequipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs \nwhich cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.\n Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.\nAll Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.

Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  \ntrying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  \nand my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  \nto make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  \nplace to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  \nthat the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  \nwrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  \ncould be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   \nIt could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  \nwrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  \ncorrect actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  \nmy NeXT that way.\n\nNow I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  \nproblem, and at pretty high speeds too.\n\nI don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  \npretty standard.\n\nHope this helps,\n-Avery"

There is already 512K of VRAM soldered \nto the logic board.  You add the two 256K SIMMs to this to give you a \ntotal of 1 MB.\n\n- Dale Adams"

I have only one report, which seems to indicate\n> that a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! \n\nOk.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.\nIt's small enough that I will attach it.\n\nI have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB\ncache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to\n40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective\ndifference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache\ncard certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously\nbetter.  I do not have an FPU.\n\nThe conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers\noffer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference\nbetween 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well\nunder $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.\n\nIf you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to\nsee them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!

The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but\nMODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1.\n\n>Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  \n\nSure.  Buy a used IIci motherboard.  Call Pre-Owned Electronics,\nShreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper\nor one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price\non a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find\nsomebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might\nget a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother-\nboards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway.\n\n>Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would\n>be a reasonably price to offer?\n\nAsk for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and\nShreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade\nmagazines often list considerably different prices for the \nsame items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.\n\nStill, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading \nthe ROM in a IIx.  \n-- \n-- Bill Johnston (johnston@me.udel.edu)\n-- 38 Chambers Street; Newark, DE 19711; (302)368-1949"

I don't know about sys 7.1,\nbut at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes\nchannels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a\nchannel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many\nsounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.\nThen only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to\ninspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the\nonly way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an\n*undocumented* flag and modify it.\n\nAm I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get\nrid of the bugs.\n\nAny better suggestions?

The second part is \n  posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about\n  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in\n  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are\n  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three\n  sections of this document  before posting. \n  \n         All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from\n  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory \n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory\n  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as\n  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last\n  part of the group name followed by \"-faq.Z\", e.g the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as \n  compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end\n  of  the file name when \"getting\" the file, rtfm will automatically \n  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have \n  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to \n  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/\"name\"  in the body text where\n  \"name\" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.\n  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the\n  subject \"help\" for more detailed instructions.   \n\n    \n\n ==================== \n I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)\n ====================\n  \n       Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is \n  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions\n  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve\n  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used\n  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my\n  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a\n  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box\n  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I\n  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to\n  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. \n  P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) \n  \n       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we\n  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the\n  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other\n  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially\n  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read\n  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that\n  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen\n  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has\n  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,\n  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any\n  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself\n  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup\n  news.announce.newusers.\n\n\n HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) \n     \n         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,\n  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists\n  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ\n  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part\n  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are\n  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this\n  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named\n  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by\n  \"-faq\", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is\n  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use\n  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command \n  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the \".Z\" extension when\n   you \"get\" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file\n  before sending it to you. \n  \n         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned\n  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ\n  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to\n  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere\n  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand. \n  It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a\n  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please\n  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh\n  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear\n  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong\n  where. \n  \n         To jump to a particular question search for\n  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For\n  example to find \"Where can I FTP Macintosh software?\" search for\n  the string  \"(2.1)\".  To jump to a section instead of a question\n  use a zero for  the question number.\n\n\n WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)\n\n      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of \n  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are\n  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list\n  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and \n  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in \n  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list \n  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from\n  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now\n  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently\n  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,\n  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has\n  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of\n  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform\n  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp\n  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim\n  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX\n  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux\n  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at\n  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n\n\n WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)\n  \n      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. \n  You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite\n  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask\n  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft\n  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an\n  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their\n  ways of  communicating.  \n  \n      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your\n  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too\n  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering\n  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one\n  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of\n  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a\n  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,\n  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question\n  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered\n  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few\n  network software designers.\n  \n         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. \n  If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra\n  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important\n  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. \n  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a\n  catch-all newsgroup.\n  \n         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in\n  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs\n  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications\n  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought\n  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps\n  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. \n  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases\n  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions\n  about non-communications hardware including questions about what\n  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software\n  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and\n  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about\n  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk\n  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.\n  \n         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. \n  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development\n  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit\n  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,\n  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the\n  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer\n  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. \n  \n         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY\n  technical question about an application that actually begins to\n  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent\n  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly\n  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)\n  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.\n    \n         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to\n  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We\n  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to\n  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to\n  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and\n  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is\n  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is\n  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not\n  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.\n  \n         Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the\n  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. \n  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more\n  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI\n  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a\n  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place\n  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in\n  comp.sys.mac.\n\n\n 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF\n THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND\n WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?\n\n      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as\n  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to\n  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in\n  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium\n  for answering common questions like this one.\n   \n         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail\n  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it\n  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups\n  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that\n  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the\n  section of this document that answers their question with just the\n  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to\n  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they\n  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.\n\n    \n\n === \n FTP  (2.0) \n ===\n\n WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)\n\n      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,\n  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),\n  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu\n  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several\n  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove\n  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from\n  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was\n  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the\n  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless\n  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document\n  should be available at the above sites.\n  \n       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians \n  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se\n  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in \n  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). \n  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  \n  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). \n  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au\n  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese\n  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n  (130.69.254.254). \n\n         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). \n  This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,\n  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things\n  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material\n  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other\n  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple\n  system software.  Please read the various README documents\n  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're\n  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute\n  material you find here.\n\n\n CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)\n\n      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from\n  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). \n  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH\n  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available\n  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the\n  words \"help\" and \"index\" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your\n  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files\n  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using\n  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a\n  message with just the text \"help\" (no quotes).\n\n\n WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)\n\n      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above\n  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it\n  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject \"help.\" \n  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,\n  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server\n  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi\n  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,\n  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of\n  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as \"archie\"\n  (no password is needed) and type \"prog filename\" to find what\n  you're looking for or type \"help\" for more detailed instructions. \n  For instance you would type \"prog Disinfectant\" to search for a\n  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails\n  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of\n  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with \"prog\n  Disinfectant\", you might try \"prog disi\" instead.  Substring\n  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many\n  erroneous matches add a \".*\\.hqx\" to the end of the substring, e.g.\n  \"prog disi.*\\.hqx\"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in\n  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. \n\n         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE\n  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you\n  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the\n  net where to find a particular piece of software.\n\n\n CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)\n\n      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from\n  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please\n  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about\n  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.\n\n\n WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)\n\n      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to\n  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're\n  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're\n  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format\n  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special\n  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex\n  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure\n  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary\n  protocol.\n  \n         How a file has been translated and compressed for\n  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have\n  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was\n  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file\n  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the\n  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step\n  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary\n  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress\n  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table\n  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs\n  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh\n  files as they are downloaded.\n\n***************************************************************************\nSuffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar \nExtractors\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  \nCompact Pro|         X     X \nPackit     |                           X\nUUTool     |                                                      X \nMacCompress|                                X \nSunTar     |               X     X     X                                X \nBinHex 5.0 |                     X \nBinHex 4.0 |               X \nDiskDoubler|                           X                X \nUnZip      |                                                   X \nDiskCopy   |                                     X \nmacutil    |         X     X           X                X\n***************************************************************************\n\n     A few notes on the decompressors:\n\n      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different\n  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff\n  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,\n  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will\n  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. \n  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt\n  Expander. \n    \n         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller\n  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow\n  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep\n  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous\n  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.\n   \n         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX\n  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)\n  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac\n  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators\n  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also\n  available by anonymous ftp. \n  \n         Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to\n  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading\n  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the\n  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be\n  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress\n  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0\n  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an\n  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if\n  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of\n  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the\n  info-mac/unix directory.\n\n     A few notes on the compression formats:\n\n      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file\n  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. \n  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal\n  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications\n  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating\n  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance\n  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.\n  \n      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,\n  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be\n  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of\n  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve\n  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on\n  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. \n  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have\n  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.\n  \n      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above\n  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created\n  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be\n  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some\n  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard\n  designation for self-extracting archives created with their \n  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they \n  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.\n\n\n HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)\n\n      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human\n  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a\n  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to\n  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo\n  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,\n  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. \n  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.\n    \n         If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually\n  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer \n  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of \n  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of\n  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. \n  \n         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any \n  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that \n  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by \n  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and \n  login.  Type the word \"binary.\"  Hit return.  Type \"cd\n  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression\" and hit return.  Then\n  \"get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin\"  and hit return.  Of course\n  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt\n  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this\n  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto\n  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will\n  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If\n  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still\n  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make\n  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe\n  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last\n  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals\n  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.\n  \n  \n  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)\n\n       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable\n  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac\n  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.\n  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as\n  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may \n  terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement \n  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going \n  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  \n  (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send \n  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering\n  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world \n  of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question\n  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh\n  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a \n  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\nTROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)\n================================================================= \n\n         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific\n  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. \n  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking\n  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step\n  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,\n  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system\n  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your\n  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to\n  recommend solutions to you.\n\n IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)\n\n      \"Microsoft Word is crashing\" doesn't say much.  What were you\n  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the\n  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions\n  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. \n  The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions\n  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the\n  following steps fix the problem.  For example, \"Sometimes\n  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error.\" is\n  not nearly as helpful as \"QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two\n  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already\n  contain text.\"  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug\n  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the\n  problem and see if it's still there or not.\n\n\n READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)\n\n      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and\n  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the\n  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound\n  familiar.\n\n\n CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)\n\n      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus\n  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and\n  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  \n   \n       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,\n  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file\n  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This\n  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring\n  from original masters will normally fix this.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  \n\n      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file\n  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. \n  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean\n  reinstall. \n  \n         If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these\n  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your\n  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the\n  program.  So it's time to\n\n\n ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  \n \n         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem\n  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the\n  cause of a system or application crash:\n  \n     a.\tRun only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do\n     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself\n     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin\n     launching other applications until you find the one that causes \n     the crash.\n     \n     b.\tIf you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're\n     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you \n     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially \n     when performing complicated operations.\n     \n     c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit\n     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile\n     software out there including some from companies that really \n     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  \n     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its \n     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.\n     \n     d.\tBoot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears\n     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove\n     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense\n     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs\n     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the\n     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the\n     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,\n     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have\n     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the\n     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the\n     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the\n     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the\n     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make \n     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.\n\n\n CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)\n\n      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why\n  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the\n  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work\n  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the\n  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.\n\n    \n\n ====================== \n PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)\n ======================\n\n      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a\n  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot\n  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to\n  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's\n  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step\n  program should be performed about every three months. \n\n\n TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)\n\n      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more\n  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a\n  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,\n  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for\n  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've\n  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements\n  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no\n  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several\n  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty \n  the trash.\n\n\n RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)\n\n      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. \n  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension \n  in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an\n  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably\n  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes\n  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. \n  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no\n  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your\n  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. \n\n\n REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)\n\n      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary\n  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It\n  lets the system know what application should be launched when you\n  open a given file and what icons it should display where. \n  Depending on its size each application has one or more\n  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files\n  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become\n  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. \n  Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with\n  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than\n  to defeat an incumbent. \n  \n         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments\n  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice\n  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments\n  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only \n  if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed. \n  \n         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your\n  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. \n  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild\n  the desktop and warning you that \"This could take a few minutes.\" \n  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you\n  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may\n  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.\n   \n          If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing\n  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's\n  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the\n  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly\n  corrupt data structures.    \n\n\n ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)\n\n      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950\n  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain\n  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk\n  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this \"parameter\n  RAM\" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset\n  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys\n  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,\n  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the\n  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter\n  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General\n  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.\n   \n         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the \n  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is\n  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this\n  opportunity to reset it anyway.\n\n\n RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) \n\n      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most\n  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the\n  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these\n  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of\n  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough\n  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of\n  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,\n  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and\n  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this\n  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance\n  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.\n  \n         If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically\n  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6\n  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage\n  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set\n  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. \n  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot\n  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility\n  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks\n  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much\n  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,\n  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)\n\n      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if\n  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. \n  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file\n  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:\n\n    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  \n    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out \n        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.\n    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the \n        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple \n        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be \n        replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or \n        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, \n        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level \n        of the System Folder.\n    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder \n        is  fine.\n    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then \n        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your \n        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, \n        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't \n        need that waste your memory and disk space.\n    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the \n        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System \n        folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you \n        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace \n        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. \n    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.\n    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file \n        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable \n        system overall.\n\n\n     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)\n\n      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that\n  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even\n  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility\n  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System\n  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in\n  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier \n  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com\n  and run it on all your hard disks.\n     \n         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that\n  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid\n  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything\n  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general\n  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's\n  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh\n  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well\n  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. \n  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of\n  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features\n  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.\n   \n         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they\n  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and\n  reformat (4.9).\n\n\n     BACKING UP  (4.8)\n\n      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be\n  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back\n  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies\n  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate\n  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back\n  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three\n  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. \n  \n         A number of programs are available to make backing up\n  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with\n  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup\n  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder\n  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the\n  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup\n  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.\n  \n         Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network\n  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should\n  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,\n  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There\n  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD\n  Backup from System 6.  \n\n\n DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)\n\n      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free\n  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the\n  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be\n  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more\n  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several\n  ways to defragment a hard disk.\n  \n         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your\n  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while\n  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.\n   \n         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for\n  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.\n  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag\n  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the\n  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before\n  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO\n  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the\n  net by asking for one. \n\n\n REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)\n\n      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a\n  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't\n  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is\n  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means\n  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even\n  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are\n  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate\n  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3\n  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may\n  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator\n  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not\n  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.\n     \n         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to\n  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. \n  Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal\n  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. \n  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with\n  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat\n  your hard disk.\n  \n         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available\n  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like\n  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk\n  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the\n  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition\n  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware\n  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones\n  bundled with your hard disk. \n  \n         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and\n  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter\n  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and\n  data losses are a very good possibility.\n  \n\n\n  Elliotte Rusty Harold         Department of Mathematics\n  elharo@shiva.njit.edu         New Jersey Institute of Technology\n  erh0362@tesla.njit.edu        Newark, NJ 07102"

To\nrecapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor\nmomentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an\neighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right\nafter I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that\nradically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens\nwith no provocation whatsoever.\n\nI have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was\na man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the\nproblem was that the 13\" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always\nkeep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from\na largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's\npower supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was\nreally wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that\nit had to be endured.)\n\nThis seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to\nadopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13\" monitor\nowner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the \nApple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading\nJitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement\nof a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,\nthe swap of a circuit board.\n\nI would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had\nexperience with this sort of thing."

I was doing continuous background sound with\ninterrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V\ndocumentation.\n\nYou probably were cancelling your callback commands out of\nyour channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if\nyou have problems with sounds working when you play one per\nchannel and then close the channel (with the related\nslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't\nwork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a\nchannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\nchannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you\nwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you\nare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.\n\nNow before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the\nsound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses\nit. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you\ncan too.\n\nOne little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the\nSound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not\nsure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your\nsounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the\nSound Manager.\n\n-Steve"

A new system facility\ncalled the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by\napplications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.\n\nThe Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support\nfor up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an\nFPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will\nrequire a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.\nUsers will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the\nCyclone's.\n\nFor more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek."

You turn on\nyour computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it\ncools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles\nof this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics\nare much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact\nportable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function\nthat extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal\ncycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my\ncomputer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it\noff (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the\nphosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in\nthe computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue\nlife of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular\narchitecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :\") \n\nCharles Kuehmann\nNorthwestern University\nSteel Research Group"

        "subject": "Quadra Clock Modification - Long",
        "content": "Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed. Previously I\nhad been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU\nbut this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.\n\nYour mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted\nbefore hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.\nI didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher\nspeeds.\n\nParts\n\n\tClock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of\n\tspeeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the\n\toscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend\n\tgetting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.\n\n\t   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for\n\t   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:\n\n\t\t   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)\n\t\t   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)\n\t\t   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)\n\n\t   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.\n\n\t   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a\n\t   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)\n\t   \n\tSocket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as\n\t   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins\n\t   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.\n\n\tCooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a \n\t   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had\n\t   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which\n\t   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up \n\t   something similar or risk frying your CPU.\n\t   \nProcedure\n\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.\n\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from\n\tthe back of the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic\n    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,\n\trear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.\n\t\n9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to\n    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.\n\t\n10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of\n    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic\n\tPower light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The\n\tmotherboard then comes directly out.\n\t\n11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the\n    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators\n\tmust be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.\n\t\n\tVery carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of\n\tthe pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure\n\tyour desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.\n\t\n\tI used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is\n\tNOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is\n\ta multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without\n\tproper care.\n\t\n12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.\n\n13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the\n\told clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the\n\tsocket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new\n\t50 mhz clock.\n\t\n14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.\n\t\n14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.\n\n15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother\n    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.\n\t\n16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n18) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.\n\n21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn \n    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,\n\tsomething is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your\n\thandiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.\n\t\n\tHopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and\n\treplace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and\n\tbe astounded. \n\t\n\tYou will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding\n\ta particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up\n\tmight take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since\n\tmodifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single\n\tproblem.\n\t\nGood Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real\nrisk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than\n$50 in parts.\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>"

        "content": "This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their\nIIsi clock oscillator. I have attempted to gather as many case histories as\npossible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies\nprobably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that\nsuccess rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24\nmachines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.\nThis is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.\n\nThanks to all who contributed to this poll. \n\n\nIssues:\n\n\tSpeed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without\n\t\tadd on cards. All reported machines were able to use\n\t\t25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple\n\t\tNubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter\n\t\twas able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to\n\t\tachieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place\n\t\n\t\tAt speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and\n\t\thi density floppy disk problems have been reported.\n\t\t\n\t\tNote: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not\n\t\t\ttested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,\n\t\t\tthe 25 mhz operational machines may well work at\n\t\t\thigher speeds.\n\t\t\t\n\tDamage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was\n\t\trepaired and the machine is operational. One other\n\t\treported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator\n\t\tduring desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user\n\t\tputting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.\n\t\t\n\t\tNo reports of static discharge damage.\n\t\t\n\t\tNo reports of high speed operation causing damage.\n\t\t\n\t\tThen again, I also don't have any reports from users of\n\t\tdefective parachutes.\n\t\t\n\tAdd on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus\n\t\tAdapters. Several other add on boards have been used with\n\t\tsuccess. See case histories\n\t\t\n\tHeat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.\n\t\tThese were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some\n\t\tused epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab\n\t\tof cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a\n\t\tbolt through the hole in the motherboard.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nCase Histories:\t\n\nAll speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator).

This is pretty standard in portable machines, and the\nsame kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning off\nscreens, reducing clock speed, etc.  The advantage of this over just turning\nthe thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2)\nthe machine is still available over the network.\n\n\tThe tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity.\nCertainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody\npinged you, but you do want to wake up (at least the CPU) if somebody\nlogs in via a telnet connection.\n\n\tI wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter\nmonths; that energy is just getting turned into heat.

This may include the ability for the system to fully power down\nthe monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on\nautomatically.  (Is this a \"sell\" on screen saver software companies?)\n\nGoals for \"idle\" power consumption have been set at something like 30\nwatts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on\nthis).\n\nNote that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,\nespecially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.\nSun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for\nthe night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per\nyear.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would\nprobably have greater than double that value.\n\nGiven that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and\nhome computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),\nbuilding power consumption control into all machines has a potential to\ncut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard.\n\nBTW: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving\nwork, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors\nwith the power switch on front.  There was some indication that\nmonitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate\nlots of power cycling.  This may only apply to the monitors we use, but\nmight be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch\nin back."

I can't imagine that it would be cheaper \nto build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and \nexceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago.  \nIt's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts - \nthis could cause problems in a Q800.  I'm not sure why you'd want to do \nthis, though, as a dual-bank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a \nsingle-bank composite one.\n\n- Dale Adams"

The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSI\nchip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2\nmodes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI\nperformance over the Q900.

Almost every piece of computer equipment\n I own/use has the switch on the back (including external hard drives and\n modems--why?). I hope front-mounted switches become the norm, and soon.\n\n Rich\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\nRichard C.

This past month, I bought a Quadra 800 and am now \nusing the Sony on it.  My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who\nis planning on getting an Apple 14\" monitor (The Trinitron one).  My\nquestion is this:  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple\nmonitor.  Does it come with two types?  As I recall, one can hook up the\npower cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my \nQuadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which\nallows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into the\nsocket separately.  So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow\nhim to do this?  Will have to buy a different cable?  IF yes, where can he\npurchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables?\n\nThanks in advance,\nDerek\n\n\n\n\n******************************************************************************\n  DEREK FONG                           *   EMAIL: thewho@plume.mit.edu\n  Dept. of Physical Oceanography       *          thewho@darla.whoi.edu\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBldg 54-1511A                          * Clark Laboratory 317\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology  * Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\nCambridge, MA 02139                    * Woods Hole, MA 02543\n(617) 253-2922                         * (508) 457-2000 x2814\n*******************************************************************************"

        "content": "THe origional bit is missing but long/short follows:\n\n    The origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga\nmonitor with a centris (hence title).  \n\n    The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use any\nold vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a\nMac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two\nmachines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a\nthree row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.\n\n    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.\n The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400\nresolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above\nadaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my\n1604s).\n\nTHen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would\nadvocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As\nto the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because\nthey will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.\n    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN\nCONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU\nTO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND\nTHEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.\n\npersonal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers\ndoesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to\nfind out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the\nsync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits\n(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most\nfavorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a\nspecialized application video card).(i.e. \"well you can get a resolution\n1168x832 on this $5,  9\" \"super smelly sock\" monitor that will let you\ndisplay TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably\npriced \"oder eater\" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an\nultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz\nvertical.\")\n\n\n\nNote:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video\nboard using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the\nsides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as\npossible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an\ninch.\n\n                                                                    -A."

What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time\nthe video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the\nMac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video\ncircuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,\neven pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's\npretty hard to hit menu items ;-)\nWe had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem\nhas been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has\nvaried. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the\ncache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not\nobviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU\nright?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did\nnot keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have\nhas this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,\nbut did it twice within an hour yesterday).\nThe technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty\nsharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had\npreviously tried ourselves anyway). These included:\n-swapping the RAM\n-swapping the VRAM\n-swapping monitors (3 different 13\" Apple RGB and 2 16\" Apple RGB)\n-swapping cables\n-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy\n-sacrificing various small mammals\nHere are some other facts:\n-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed\n (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)\n-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards\n that exhibit it in our lab\n-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards\n that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as\n faulty according to us.\nHere are some speculations:\n-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that\n much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do\n with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can\n reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).\n-the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our\n walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We\n have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in\n the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do\n not want to believe it.\n-it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past\n security at the entrance to our site.\n\nHas anyone any ideas?

If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the\nmonitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go\nfrom the monitor to the back of the computer.\n\n2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing\npower cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the\ncomputer.\n\nBoth cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer\nstores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at\ngood prices).

I've seen this sort \nof effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT \nconflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video \nhardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the \nQ950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to \n24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - \nit's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed \nthen.\n\nAnother thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like \nQuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.  This reprograms (some \nof) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored.\n\n- Dale Adams"

Its just  \nthat the newer CD ROM drives have both capability.  Multisession means that  \nwhen you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session, the drive can  \nread and display them.  Double speeds just transfer ANY type of data (excluding  \nsound) at around double the speed.\n\n> 3.

This means that you lose the ability to add  \nany more pictures after the first time (must buy a new CD).  Finally, since the  \nCD150 is not a double speed drive, it will require twice as long to transfer  \ndata (excluding sound).\n\n> Michael M.

So are drives based on the slightly-faster Toshiba\nXM3401. Some companies selling such drives are: Spin Peripherals (a\nbargain at $499) and PLI (a company I hate) and Relax Technologies\n(a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime\nplayer in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign). The NEC\nCDR74 is also a good choice (NEC's own mechanism, I think). ClubMac\nsells it for around $619.\n\n>Thanx.\n\nYour welcome, ooh but now I see your from Germany. Most of the\nmailorder info does you little good, I guess.

The Toshiba's speed\nadvantage is very slight: 20% in average access time (a minor plus)\nand 10% in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).\n\nGood luck,\nMark"

The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the\nCD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless\nyou get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.\n\n  You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just faster\nreading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD,\nbut only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.\n\nPaul"

The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close\nto the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so\nmuch a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.\nWhy else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business\napplication. \n\nWhat do you mean by 'no \"retail price\"'.  Quite the contrary, I think.\nThe price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,\nIMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling\nrequired.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One\nprice, medium performance, ready to go.\n\nWhen I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears\n(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and\nBizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the\nother was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who\nwent the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who\nsells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I\nsuspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know\ndidly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any\nof the  Apple dealers I spoke with...\n\nIf you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from\nMontgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.

I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as a\nusenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour (I run uAccess)\nand receives all my faxes.\n\nI do turn off the monitors hooked up to it.  They produce more heat\nthan I want - it can be warm in my garage office in the summer.  I've\ngot one of those handy power control centers ($25 at Fry's) to I just\nflip the switch in front when I start or stop working.\n\nBy the way, this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by Apple since\ntheir new Color Classic will turn off its own monitor after a certain\nlength of idle time.\n\n--  Michael Peirce      --   peirce@outpost.sf-bay.org\n--  Peirce Software     --   Suite 301, 719 Hibiscus Place\n--                      --   San Jose, California USA 95117\n--  Makers of:          --   voice: +1.408.244.6554 fax: +1.408.244.6882\n--             Smoothie --   AppleLink: peirce & America Online: AFC Peirce"

(no joke)  Here is the\ndeal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a\ndisection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehow\ndrawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know\nNADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I\nwnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing\nlist?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms.\nOk here it goes:\n\n\tWe are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms\noffered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price\nand reliability, the second being VERY important.\n\tHow much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you\nthink?\n\tOk, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard\n(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time\ngreat wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is\njust a reliable?  Price?\n\tPrinters:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the\nThermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit\naccess so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in\nterms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) \nPrice? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or\nsuch to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is\nthe Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. \nSuggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through\nand they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy\nto maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).\n\tFinally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting\nthese things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the\nnet, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to be\nastronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask\nthem?\n\tLittle more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot\nabout macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have the\ntime to go and look for all of this stuff.

Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen\nand sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer.  In\nboth cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it\nback in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback,  my\nmarginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are\n\"lopsided\" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after\ntime they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the\nkeyboard or something?  \n\nAnyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow you\ncould support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving.\n\nI've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a\n2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution.\n\nPlease email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world.\n\nTed\n\n\n\nTed Schreiber\nMechanical Enginering \nNorthwestern University\nTel: 708.491.5386 FAX 708.491.3915 Email: rts@nwu.edu"

However...\n\n(2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal\nthe Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch \"high resolution color\ndisplay\"---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode.\n\nSo, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you\nneed (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the\nVGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use\nit's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor\nthat can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over\nthe VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot\nproduce).\n\nAs far as (a) above is concerned, contact\n\n James Engineering, Inc.\n 6329 Fairmount Ave.\n El Cerrito, CA  94530\n 510-525-7350\n FAX: 510-525-5740\n\nThey can probably get you the right adapter.  Remember: you do *not*\nwant the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to\nhave your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer\nwill just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want\nan adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style\nconnectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry\nfor the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.\n\nAs far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal\nwith a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of\n67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison,\nthe VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and\na 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.\n\nThe monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as\nthe Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes\nin the PC compatible world.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\t-Fred Martin\n\n\n-- \nFred Martin | fredm@media.mit.edu | (617) 253-7143 | 20 Ames St. Rm.

When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M\nharddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space \nwould cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-\nuartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and \nyou will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  \n\nParticularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a\nseveral-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files \nwith DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like \nos, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are \npricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much\nit would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a \nuseful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though\nI must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my \ncomputer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to \nbecause I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, \nsoftPC or trying any unix os!)\n\n-Peter\nbell@minerva.cis.yale.edu"

While traveling with it (it was in my\nSE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs\nholding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel\nwas coming forward away from the rest of the drive.  I lived with this situation\nuntil it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a\nnetwork shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me\nsome dead time during which to have the drive sent out).\n\nI called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the\ntab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers --\nthough nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my\nmodem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm\nnever flying with my SE/30 again).  And when I called back to ask whether I\ncould send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem\nwith that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a\nday (they're usually good for 10 days).  The front panel was replaced under\nwarranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class\ninsured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed\nEx by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was\ntraveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]).\n\nThe only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked\nto, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the\ndrive mechanism out and send just the case.  Unfortunately, I discovered the\nday I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little\nseal and thus voiding the warranty!  Oh, well.\n\nAl\nalbert@seas.ucla.edu"

I was hoping to use \nsystem 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica.  However, I can't \nrun system 7 from a floppy, so I can't get enough RAM.  \n\tAny suggestions?

I like to leave my\ncomputer on if I think I'm going to be using it withing the next 2 or\n3 hours, but I get sick of my Dad constantly coming up to me and\nasking \"Why is the computer on if you're not using it?\"  I also\nwonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage from\nother things (garbage disposal, etc.)  Here are my questions:\n \nHow much harm do voltage fluctuations cause?  My computer does not\nshare a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when a\nrefrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on (whose\ndoesn't?), and also when the washing machine does anything.  All\nthese things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer,\nright?  I also notice the fan in my System Saver turning at different\nspeeds.  Is it safer to turn it off and back on when I want to use it\nor to leave it on?\n \nHow much electricity does my computer use?  I have an Apple IIgs (ne\nflames), with a Kensington System saver GS (1 electric fan inside),\nan AppleColor RGB monitor, and an EXTERNAL 3.5\" HD (1 fan and its own\nP/S).  How do I translate this into Kilowatt-Hours?  Also, how much\nof this is used by the monitor?\n \nDoes the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen is\ntotally black but still on?\n \nMany computers spin the HD up and down constantly to save power.  I\nalways thought this was harmful to the HD and defeats the purpose of\nleaving the computer on in the first place (except portables).  Is\nthis true?\n \nThanks for the Info.  I think this will help lots of people.\n \nStacy"
