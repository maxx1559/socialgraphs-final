The number of characters\nX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }\nX       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.\nX\nX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:\nX\nX---entry---\nXrule:\t1993\nXfix:\ty or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)\nXtitle:\ttitle of entry  \t\t    (see comments below)\nXentry:\tEntry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)\nXdate:\tDate/time of submission in UTC\t    (see comments below)\nXhost:\tMachine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested\nX\tUse tab indented lines if needed\nX---remark---\nX    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if\nX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a\nX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th\nX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.\nX---author---\nXname:\tyour name\nXorg:\tSchool/Company/Organization\nXaddr:\tpostal address\nX\tuse tab indented lines to continue\nX\tdon't forget to include the country\nXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.\nX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.\nXanon:\ty or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)\nX---info---\nXIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in\nXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info\nXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.\nX---build---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program\nXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting\nXfile must be 255 bytes or less.\nX---program---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode\nXinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.\nX---end---\nX\nX      Regarding the above format:\nX\nX\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*\nX\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.\nX\nX\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should\nX\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,\nX\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.\nX\nX\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect\nX\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() \nX\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\nX\nX\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\nX\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the \nX\t  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same \nX\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be \nX\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\nX\nX\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above \nX\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\nX\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\nX\t  Email message to the judges.\nX\nX\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless \nX\t  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.\nX\nX\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\nX\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\nX\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\nX\nX\t* The entry's remarks should include:\nX\t    - what this program does\nX\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\nX\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\nX\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\nX\t    - information about any ---data--- files\nX\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated\nX\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\nX\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\nX\nX\t* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain\nX\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\nX\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They \nX\t  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple \nX\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX\t   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX\t   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX\t       digit, followed by '.c'\nX\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not \nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is\nX       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:\nX\nX\t\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate\nX\t\tobfuscate@toad.com\nX\nX       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.\nX\nX       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries\nX       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.\nX       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for\nX       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.\nX\nX    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry\nX       must be sent in a separate Email letter.\nX\nX   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  \nX       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.\nX\nX   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,\nX       special owner or group) are not allowed.\nX    \nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX    \nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many \nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners \nX    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts.\nX\nX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)\nX\nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.\nX\nX    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentry\nX    program.

Xt Glossary\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\n\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\n  widgets or gadgets.\n\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Related FAQ's\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\n\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \ncomp.windows.x.  \n\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \nto comp.windows.x.motif.\n\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\n\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\n\nWhy don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.\n\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly\nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\non the visual being used.  \n\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\nbecause the basic information you need is available.

Which visual should an application use?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\nsuch).\n\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\nor just monochrome.\n\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above \nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\nshell.\n\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\n\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\nvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\n\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\nlist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among\nother things.\n\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\n\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\texit (0);\n\t}\n\nOne can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\noccur.  \n\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\n\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\ndifficult to maintain practices.\n\nTry the following code instead.\n\n\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n\n\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern void ExitCallback (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw,\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure,\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\n\t\t\t\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\n\t}\n\n\tBoolean\n\tExitWorkProc (closure)\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\n\t{\n\t\texit (0);\n\t\t/*NOTREACHED*/\n\t}\n\n\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\n\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\nnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\nOS's it is the poll() system call.\n\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\n\nIt's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\nreliable.  In particular:\n\n\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\n\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\n\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\n\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\n\n\t- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.\n\n\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\n\t  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing\n\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\n\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\n\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\n\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\n\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\n\t  been given the whole block).\n\n\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this\npoint I don't know.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective\nit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full\ndetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already\nfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may\nnot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which\nmeans its a 1000 pages.\n\nAsente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \"X Window System Toolkit, The\n\tComplete Programmer's Guide and Specification\", Digital Press,\n\t1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\n\tPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC\n\tDirect at 1-800-DIGITAL.\n\nThe other book I commonly recomend to novices is:\n\nYoung, Doug. \"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with\n\tXt (Motif Version),\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).\n\t(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)\n\nAnd of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.\nO'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt\nreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively\noverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it\nvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to\nother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related\ninformation.\n\nI read two periodicals, \"The X Resource\" and the \"The X Journal\".\nThese are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \"The X Resource\"\nis published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the\nMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no\nadvertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For\norders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial\nmatters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at\nmath.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in\n~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.\n\n\n\"The X Journal\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.\nThe articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical\naudience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an\nexpectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a\nfairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good\ncollection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call\n(908) 563-9033.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n14. What Widgets are available?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are three popular widget sets:\n\nAthena\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\n\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\n\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\nMotif\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\n\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\n\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\n\t  it is poorly implemented.\nOLIT\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\n\t  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by\n\t  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.\n\t  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\n\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\n\nXtra\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\n\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\n\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\n\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen\n\t  them so I can't comment.\nFWF\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\n\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\n\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\n\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\n\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\nXcu\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\n\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\n\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\n\t  widely used.\nXs\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\n\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\nXw\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\n\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\n\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\n\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\n\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\n\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\nXo\t- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you\n\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\n\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\n\nTbl\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif\n\t  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.\nPlots\t- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).\n\t  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t__________________________________________\n\tName\t\tLanguage\tVendor\n\t__________________________________________\n\tXview\t\tC\t\tSun\n\tOI\t\tC++\t\tParcPlace\n\tInterviews\tC++\t\tStanford\n\tTcl/tk\t\tC\t\tsprite.berkeley.edu\n\t__________________________________________\n\n\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\n\ttypdef struct\n\t{\t\n\t    String\tname;\n\t    long\tvalue;\n\t} Arg;\n\nand the code:\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\n\nexpands to\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\targ.name = \"name\";\n\targ.value = 3.2;\n\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\nhow to get around this?\n\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\n\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\n    } else { \\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\n    }\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\n\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\n\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\n\n    string to data type\n    data type to string\n    data type to data type\n\ni) string to data type\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\n\n\tName\t\tValue\n\t\"True\"\t\t1\n\t\"False\"\t\t0\n\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\n\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\n    of the converters.\n\nii) data type to string\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\n\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\n\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\n    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\n    that they are consistent.\n\niii) data type to data type\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\n    red, green and blue.\n\n\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\n\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\n\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\n    Display *dpy;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\n\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\nconverted value:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    unsigned int    size;\n    caddr_t         addr;\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\n\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\nreturn True.\n\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\n\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\n\t    { \\\n\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n\t      return False; \\\n\t    } \\\n\t  else \\\n\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n      return True;\n\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n\t  return False; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n      return True;\n\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\nconverter is being called properly.\n\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\n\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    XtAppContext context;\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\nXtSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\nused.\n\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\n\n    XtCacheNone\t\tDon't cache any converted values\n    XtCacheAll\t\tCache all converted values\n    XtCacheByDisplay\tCache converted values on a per display basis\n\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\n\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\n\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\n\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\n    XtAppContext context;\n    XrmValuePtr to;\n    XtPointer converter_data;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\n\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\nR5 distribution:\n\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\nand remove it from the application context.\n\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\nhappen 3 ways:\n\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\n\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\n\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\n\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\n\nI'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\n\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\nproblem.\n\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\ndemonstrates this:\n\n#include <setjmp.h>\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\n\nvoid\nXIOHandler (dpy)\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\n{\n\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\n\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n\t...\n\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\n\t\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\n}\n\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\npurpose it is adequate.\n\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\nconnect to a display.\n\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\n\n\t1. Args passed at creation time.\n\t2. Command line arguments.\n\t3. User's per host defaults file\n\t4. User's defaults file.\n\t5. User's per application default file.\n\t6. System wide per application default file.\n\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\n\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\n\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nbut most do not.\n\nA user may have many per application default files containing\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\nis found.\n\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\n\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\n\n\t%N\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\n\t\tapplication's class name.\n\t%T\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n\t\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\n\t%C\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\n\t%S\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\n\t%L\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n\t%l\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n\t%t\tThe territory part of the display's language string\n\t%c\tThe codeset part of the display's language string\n\nLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\nLet's consider another example. This time, let's set\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\n\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\n\nWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\nlike this:\n\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\n\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\nbatch of default settings.)\n\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\n\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\nguarantee the order of execution.\n\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\nlist.\n\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\nsays:\n\n \t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\n \tprocedure is to be appended.\"\n \nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\nlist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\n\n> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible\n> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core\n> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag\n> stays set to TRUE.\n\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\n\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\n\n> Is this a problem with \"mwm\" or is there something\n> else which needs to be done?\n\nYou'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\n\n> If the problem is \"mwm\", what is the fastest\n> way to determine if a window is iconified? \n\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\nsuggestions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can't.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\nhandled something like:\n\n\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t{\n\t\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\n\t\texit (1)\n\t}\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\n\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\n\telse\n\t\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\n\t++count;\n\nto be written as:\n\n\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\n\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\n\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\nstructure or copying a string:\n\n\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\n\t  char\t     *ptr;\n\t  char\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\n\n\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\t/* takes care of type casting */\n\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\n\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\n\n\t char\t      *ptr;\n\n\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\n\t /* ... */\n\t free (ptr);\n\nmay not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\n\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst, I'd recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey\nat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\n\n\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\n\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\n\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\n\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\n\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\n\tmalloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\n\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\n\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\n\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\n\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\n\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly\n\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\n\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\n\nAn alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\nmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\nfor more info)\n\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\nserver are asynchronous.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\nFor example:\n\n    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &\n    example% xwininfo -tree\n\t     <click in new xload window>\n\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\nof errant widgets.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\ntest the way a widget manages it's children, you can try\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\nof both.  It's a very clever idea.\n\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\nUnfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to\nyour application which is stopped.\n\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\nusing a command sequence like this:\n\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\n\tthismachine% gdb application\t# Your favorite debugger.\n\tor this:\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% gdb application\n\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\n\t(gdb) run ...\n\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\n\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\ndeal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \n\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\nyou won't get those events.\n\nFor example:\n\n\t...\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\n\t\t\t\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\n\t\t\t\t   &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\n\n\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\n\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\n\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\n\nwould never invoke the timeout.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\n\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\n``intuitive'' fashion.\n\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\n\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\nprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\nas it is based on Xt).\n\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\nconventions, for more details read the code.\n\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\nanyway.\n\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also\navailable on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.\n-- \nPete Ware\t\t\t\t\tware@cis.ohio-state.edu\nCIS Dept, Ohio State University\t\t\tw/ (614) 292-7318\n228 Bolz Hall, 2036 Neil Ave.\t\t\th/ (614) 538-0965\nColumbus, OH 43210"

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->\t\t      |\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |\nX    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |\nX    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.\t      |\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of\nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You\nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer\nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as\nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many\nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.

The rules, and sometimes the contest Email\nX    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may\nX    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical\nX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not\nX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical\nX    closing date for contests are in early May.\nX\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\nX    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines\nX    prior to submitting entries.

The first two years consisted of five subjects:\nSoftware Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 \nassembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and \nCommunication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group\ndiscussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).\nThe third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company \nfor a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special \nTravel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  \nThe fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering \n(C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing \nTheory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where \nstudents worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an \noutside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change \nsuddenly).\n \nIn the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and \nexams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a \n30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework \nassessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?\n\nBTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by\nHonours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying\nto sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). \n\nCheers,\n  Michael \n-- \n| Michael S. A.

Affected programs include rgb and \nthe server.\n\n\tThis is from the GCC manual:\n\n\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \n\tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\n\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \n\treference.\n\n\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\n\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.\n\n\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\n\t`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.\n\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \ncompilation flags.  \n\n\tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\n\t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \n\t\trgb/rgb.c\n\n\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args or\nreturn values:  \n\t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \n\t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. \nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \nharmless as they don't involve structs.\n\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \n\t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \n\tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\n\n\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do \nthis simple test:\n\n\t#include <sys/ioctl.h>\n\tSIOCGIFCONF\n\nRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of \ninterest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like \nwhitespace).

What should these be?\n\n\tThe R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add\nthese lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:\n        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)\n        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n\n\tHowever, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so \nreferences to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the \nImakefile.

While \nbuilding and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid \nlinking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those \ndistributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  \nIf you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that \nthe shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or \n/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked \nstatically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\n\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it\nattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.\nYou can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to\nmost C compilers).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)\n\nThis is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in \nX11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was \nremoved in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5\nlibraries only applied to the documented interface).  \n\nA workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4\nor OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.\n\n[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis \n(jpf@heliocentric.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\n\n\tThere is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)\nrunning under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using \nshared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\n\t1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system\nadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used\nby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security \nproblems at your site.\n\t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\n\t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths\nto the libraries.\n\n[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]\n\nThe R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the\nnewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid\nprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this \nmay cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. \nXload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\n\n\tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits \nanyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by \naccessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps\nmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console \ndisplay.

Although it is not \nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\n\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \nobvious.\n\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\nR5 versions are different.\n\n\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\n\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\nusing Imake to build X\n\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\n\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4\nguide to imake.\n\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\nFulton on an early version of Imake\n\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\nmail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\n\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNutt\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\n\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make \n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX \nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing to\nwrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The\nX Journal, issue 2:1.\n\t- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on\ndemystifying Imake.\n\t- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in \nsasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.\n\n[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\n\n\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier \nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\n\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\n\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\n\n\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a \nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XShapeQueryExtension\n\t_XShapeCombineMask\n\n\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\n\n\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \nlibraries.\n\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \nerror \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\n\n\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that \nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\nbe called.\n\n\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \n\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\n\t2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \n\n\tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\n\t\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \n11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under \nthe current version of X, I get this message:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XtScrollBarSetThumb\n\t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\n\t_XtTextReplace\n\n\tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition\nto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4\nrelease notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\n[10/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\n\n\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\ncalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\ncan use something like the following:\n\n        XWMHints wmhints;\n        ...\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\n        wmhints.input = True;\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\n\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.\n\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \nthis done. \n\n\tIf you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\n\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\n\n\tYou can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\nspoofed in any case. \n\tFor most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so \nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \nmanager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\n\t\n\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just \nthis one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \ndistributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]\n\n\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\n\n\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\n\t{\n\tArg args[3];\n\tint i;\n\tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */\n\ti=0;\n\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\n\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\n\t...\n\t}\n\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \ndeclaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem \ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.\n[11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\n\n\tYou're probably trying to use these functions from application code.\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\n\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \nwidgets' data becoming corrupted.\n\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \navoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\n\n\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\nthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\nWhat should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \ncreating a new widget.\n\n\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and\nthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.\n\tIn general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating \nindependently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other\ncallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be \nregistered can explicitly call other functions necessary.\n\n[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?\n\n\tXtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving\ndangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not \nactually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?\n\t\n\tIt is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,\nwhich has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer\nis set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \"yes\" answer, the code drops\nout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: \n\n\tvoid quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)\n\t{\n\t\tint             answer;\n\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Really Quit?\");\n\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Are You Really Positive?\");\n\t\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t\texit(0);\n                }\n\t}\n\n\tA more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether \nto overwrite it.\n\tThis is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and\nwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the\ncalling function.

Using a window id of NULL (\"no window\") could \ncreate the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() \nbefore attempting to use the window associated with a widget. \n\tNote that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, \nbut that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also \nwait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?\n\nThe BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of \nthe screen.

(It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the \nuser enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual \ndesktop.) Substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code \nshould work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):\n\n     unsigned long valuemask;\n     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\n\n     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */\n     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;\n     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |\n         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);\n     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);\n\n     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by\n        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */\n     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,\n         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,\n         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);\n\nwhere the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,\nparticularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than\n32767.\n\nWhen you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to\nnormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse\nevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not\nhave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.\n\nIn addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor \nresource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the\ncursor without blocking pointer events.\n\n[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller \n(argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\n\n\tAn X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which \ncontinue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its \nchildren are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X \nconnection to the display. \n\tWhat you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \n\t\tclose (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));\nto close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your \nexec.

If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which \nmight be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave\nthe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points\nout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to\nXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be\ncalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by \nXlib or Xt functions.\n\tYou can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt\nhandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which\nhas previously been added.\n\n\tNote: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly \nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse \n(converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 131)  What are these \"Xlib sequence lost\" errors?\n\n\tYou may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error \nhandler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or \nXlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\n\n\tIt's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input \nboth from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but \nwhich operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or \nthe other file descriptor.\n\tA solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,\nuse XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be \ncalled every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your \nprogram's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt \ncallback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only\nnon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\n\tMost input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an \ninput handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\n\tBe careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.\nYou will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.\nXtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is \ncalled whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is\nnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always \nready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning\nand read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost\nalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the \ntype of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your \nfunction to test whether there is new data:\n\t     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;\nBut, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a \nbusy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting \na timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.\n\n[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;\nOllie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?\n\n\tYou can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting\nthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget\nwhich should receive the event.\n\t If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use \nXtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you\navoid a round-trip to the server.\n\tDepending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call\nits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.\n\n[courtesy Mark A.

However, the \nwindow is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --\nuntil your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will \ngenerally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code \nwould appear after window was created and mapped:\n  while (!done)\n    {\n      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);\n      switch (the_event.type) {\n\tcase Expose:\t /* On expose events, redraw */\n\t\tXDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);\n\t\tbreak;\n\t...\n\t}\n    }\n\n\tNote that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't \nset up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background \ncolors, so this program could previously include this code:\n  ...\n  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */\n  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */\n  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,\n                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);\n  ...\n \nNote: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is \nblack and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 \nand the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be \nreversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.\n\nAlso note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong \nthing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for \nforeground and background.\n\nAnd also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program\nif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may\nnot yet have appeared.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?\n\n\tThe 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about\none of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A \nserver can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,\nunix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --\nthe 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available \nScreens on this particular Display connection.\n\tThe macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular\nScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one\nwhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.\n\tIn Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine \nthe Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.\n\t(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros\nwhich return characteristics of the Screen have \"Display\" in the names -- \nXDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)\n\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,\nset it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The \nwindow keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're \nsure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() \nto clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read \nback that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and \nit suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD \nand Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n\tNote that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a \n(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the\npixel/pixmap however it wants.

In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have\nseveral choices:\n\t- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to\nmake non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the\nareas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers \nsupport the extension.\n\t- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for\nparticular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note \nthat there is no X notion of a \"transparent color index\".\n\t- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny \nwindows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.\n\t- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent\nwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application\nwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors\nthat will appear properly.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see also\nThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this\nlast option]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?\n\n\tWhen using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a\nbackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing\noperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that\nthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually\nrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black\nand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical\ncoincidence will break.]\n\tIf you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be \nallocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen\npre-computed values.\n\tIf you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you \ncan take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics \ncontext) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over \nred, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. \nThis foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and \nblue.\n\n[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley \n(whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?\n\n\tMake sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.

If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) \nthe XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is \nusually black. \n\n[Thanks to Paul Asente, asente@adobe.com, 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 142)  Why can't my program get a standard colormap?\nI have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the \nstandard colormap, but it doesn't work. \n\n\tXGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does \nnot create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.\nUse xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.\n\n[1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? \n\n\tThe initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most\nservers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there \n-- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using\nXFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever \ncolor you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a \nmask).

I want to check whether\nthe window exists before doing anything with it.\n\n\tBecause X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window \nwould still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an\nevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the\nevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow \nerrors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will\nwork except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed \nand its ID reallocated to another window.\n\n[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?\n\n\tYes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,\nthe server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that \nknows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except\nfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].\n\tThe problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple \napplications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the\napplications' running on different machines) is in the first application to \ncreate a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into\nit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also\nknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.\n\t[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first\napplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned\nin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]\n\tNote also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level \ncooperation among your applications. \n\tNote also that two processes can share a window but should not try to \nuse the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it \nshould close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.\n\n[mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?\n\n\tA number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not\nhandle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return \nthe wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in\nyour own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):\n\n/* Function Name: GetVRoot\n * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root\n * Arguments: the display and the screen\n * Returns: the root window for the client\n */\n#include <X11/Xatom.h>\nWindow GetVRoot(dpy, scr)\nDisplay        *dpy;\nint             scr;\n{\nWindow          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children;\nunsigned int    numChildren;\nWindow          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr);\nAtom            __SWM_VROOT = None;\nint             i;\n\n  __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, \"__SWM_VROOT\", False);\n  XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);\n  for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {\n\tAtom            actual_type;\n\tint             actual_format;\n\tlong            nitems, bytesafter;\n\tWindow         *newRoot = NULL;\n\n\tif (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,\n\t    False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,\n            &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {\n\t\t\troot = *newRoot;\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn root;\n}\n\n[courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com).

You can try setting \nthe minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. \n[1/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?\n\n\tIt's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself\n[e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- \nimagine the conflict between two such programs running.  \n\tThe only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack\nis to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily\nassuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do \nthis infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup \nmenus or other short parameter-setting windows).\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?\n\n\tThere is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of\nextension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,\neither by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games\nwith the colormap and changing the color of the contents.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?\n\n\tUsers of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help \nget notification of double-clicking.\n\tThere is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the \nprotocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do \nclient-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer\nactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you \nhave to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish \nimplementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of \nthe X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.\n\tNote that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click\nbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case\nin your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise\ncheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should\nbe the single-click action or the double-click action.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?\n\t\n\tXlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics \ncapabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics\nlibraries.\n\tYour only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to\nrender the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \"by \nhand\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via \nXPutImage(); more specifically:\n\t1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.\n\t2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).\n\t3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.\n\t4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where \n\t\ta = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)\n\t\tb = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\n\t5) render I2\n\tNote that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose\nbits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.\n\tThe high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X \nalso permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,\nalthough most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the\nsame fonts that would be found on a printer.\n\tIn addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font\non it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some\npredefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each\nglyph.\n\n[courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu), Eric Taylor \n(etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;\nLiam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]\n\n\tInterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for\nrendering rotated fonts in X.

(How do I reserve names?)\n\n\tThere are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X\nprotocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts\nare possible if different components use the same name for different things.\n\tThe MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains:\norgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types,\napplication classes, and class extension record types; and several others.\n\tThe list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5 \ntape; it is also available by sending \"send docs registry\" to the xstuff mail\nserver.\n\tTo register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send \nto xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu; be sure to include a postal address for\nconfirmation.\n\n[11/90; condensed from Asente/Swick Appendix H]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDavid B.

The more specific you\nare, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without\nall the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are\nable to respond at all.\n\n\tAlways mention what version of X you are using and where you got it \nfrom. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,\ngive details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S \nversion for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to \nmention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.\n\n\tThen tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what\nyou expected/wanted to happen.

(How do I write X-friendly applications?)\n\n\tThe Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the \nofficial X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It \ndescribes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with \nother clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need \nto read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the \nselection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window \nmanager.  Get it either:\n\t- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT\n\t- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \"X Window System\" book\n\t- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \"X Protocol\nReference Manual.\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.\n\tThe version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to \nthe efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the \npresentation.\n\n[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]\n\n\t- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's\n\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\". The complete document is on the R5\ntapes.\n\n\tAlternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \"RTFM\" and is\nthe most-important of the least-read X documents.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?\n\n\tThe MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the\ndevelopment of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of \ncooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software \ninterfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.\n\tMIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and \nadministrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the \nConsortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, \nMember (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).\n\tMost of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, \nwith meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,\ninterest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  \nTypically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with \nothers acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification\nis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium\nas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public \nreview (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.\n\tYour involvement in the public review process or as a Member or \nAffiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.\n\tWrite to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer \nScience, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.\n\n[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4\ndistribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?\n\n\tOPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK\nwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was\ndeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF \nmembers. \n\n\tOPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; \nthere are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.\nMotif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the \none from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce \nprograms which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's \n(formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \"virtual toolkit\" which provides objects in the\nstyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.\n\n\tOPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising \ntheir OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.\n\n[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?\n\n\tOpen Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system \nthat combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface \nspecification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including\nthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and\na number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).\n\n[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?\n\n\tDECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI \ntoolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a \nsession manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, \ndxpsview, etc.).\n\n(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)\n[8/90] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  15)  What is PEX?\n\n\tPEX is the \"PHiGS Extension to X\".\n\tPHiGS stands for \"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics \nSystem\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation \nand manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in \nhardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension \nallows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized \nhardware for 3D graphics.\n\tSun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely \nredistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample\nimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \ntheir workstations and X terminals.\n\n[last modified 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\n\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\n\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \n\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do \nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\n\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\n\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \npseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\n   (1)\tYou don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't \n\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \n\tconnected), and\n   (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\n\thave to cross the serial interface, and\n   (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \n\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \n\tblocks to compress.\n\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \nNCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \nimplementation available in R6.\n\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\nin contrib/ in the following files:\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\n\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\n\n\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\n\n\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\n\n\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\n\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\n\ttwm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\nre-parenting window manager. \n\tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\n\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \n\trtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\n\tdxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\n\thpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\n\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\n\ttekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering \n\tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\nGuide functionality\n\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\n\tgwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\n\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\n\tpswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\n\tswm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\nfrom the resources file\n\ttwm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\n\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \nfrom export. [3/92]\n\ttvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\navailable on archive servers\n\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is \navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\n\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\n\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \n\tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals \n\tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\n\tvuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\n\t4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM\n\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\n\n\tIt needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\n\t\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\n\n\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \nLook for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are \nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\n[10/90]\n\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the \nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\napplications and the resource database. \n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?\n\n\tDEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\n\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\n\n\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The X\nprotocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\na capability not supported by all systems.\n\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \nfrom MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the \nkeyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\n\n\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \ndoes not do \"macro expansion.\"\n\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \naccept a translation resource such as:\n\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\n\t\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\ncharacters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\ncontrol character you want to include.\n\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\nhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?\n\n\tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window \nor the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. \nThe file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr \nclient and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\n\t\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an\nundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the \ncommand-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for \nspecifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\n\n\tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of \narbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.\nThere are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]\nis the most recent.\n\txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders \nXPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;\nsee xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.\n\tA screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr\nis available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: \nsoft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.\n\txprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available\nfrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.\n\n\tTo post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,\nwhich is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps\nand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for \nuse in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and\ncontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive\nservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\n\n\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and\nsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\n\n\tAlso: \n\n\tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter \n2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net\nin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\n\n\tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-\ncapture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and \nnon-PostScript printers.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) \ninclude session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portion\nof screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which \ncan be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, \nhave a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals \nhave local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct \nsupport for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package \nto massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\n\n\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \n\t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color \nPostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \n\t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.\nYou can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick \ndistribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\n\n\tThis can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider \ninstead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?\n\n\tThe likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ \nPortable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting \namong various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, \ngray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\n\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in \nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\nIt's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\n\n\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \nGraeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\n\n\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \nit, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; \nsee the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\n\tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.\nConversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available\nvia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, \nand ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\n\n\tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads\nand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image\nmanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as\ncontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\n\n\tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar \nto PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, \nweedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.\n\n\tXim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential \ninteractive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is \na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\n\n\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \nexport's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\n\n\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\nas part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x.

The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version\nof the control sequences. [1/93]\n\nOther good sources of information include the R4 version of that document\nand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a \ncompilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 \nsequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was \npublished in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).\n\nIn a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.\n\n[last updated 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?\n\n\tIn order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to \n\"stty pass8\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as \n\tXTerm*font: \t-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n\tXTerm*boldfont:\t-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]\n\nIn addition, you may want to set this in your shell:\n\tsetenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1\n\n        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with \nthe Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using\n`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') \nis Alt-'. \n\n[thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea \n(gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?\n\n\tYou are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give \na resource specification like this:\n\t\txterm*geometry: 80x24\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \nBut its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\n\t\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\n\n\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \n\t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\n\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\nadapted to do this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\n\n\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\n\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also \nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \nXtResolvePathname()):\n\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\n                application's class name.\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n        %t      The territory part of the display's language string\n        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string\n\n\tLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\n\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\n\tLet's consider another example. This time, let's set \nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\n\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \nMyterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\n%S are useless.\n\n\tWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization \nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\n\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\n\n\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\nthis batch of default settings.)\n\n\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory \nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\n\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \nby a slash.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\n\nThe answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \n\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \n\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\n\t#!/bin/sh\n\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a \ngeneral hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.\n\n[Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?\n\n\tWhen xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login\nfiles. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;\nor you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and\nsource it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,\nif you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your \n.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting\nyour .xsession file off with \"#!/bin/csh\". \n\tIf this doesn't work, also try starting off with:\n\t\t#!/bin/sh\n\t\t# Reset path:\n\t\tPATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?\n\n\tThere are several ways to avoid having to do a \"setenv DISPLAY ...\"\nwhenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.\n\tOne solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It \nincludes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and\nxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.\nA more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.\n\tOne solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse\n(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from\n132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and\n$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then \npropagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\n\t\teval `xrlogind`\nwhere xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special \nformat it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to \nrecreate the environment variables. [11/90]\n\n\tIn addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on \nanother host, and you find\n\t\trsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY \ntoo simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh \ncan be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be \n\t\txrsh <HOST> xterm\n\n  #! /bin/sh\n  # start an X11 process on another host\n  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT\n  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>\n  # rsh $host -n \"setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null\"\n  #\n  # An improved version:\n  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)\n  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)\n  #\n  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X \nJournal for more information.\n\tThe R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained \na number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format\nand a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.\n\tAn easier way is to use the \"xfed\" client to modify an existing font; a\nversion is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is \navailable for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], \npossibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce\nBDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.\n\tThe xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,\nXPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in\n/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed \n[5/91] in export:/contrib. \n\tIf you are a MetaFont user you can use \"mftobdf\" from the SeeTeX\ndistribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution\nis on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\tThe GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,\na font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.\n\tThe O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these\ntools to modify a font.\n\tFonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is\nin ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?\n\n\tAfter you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, \ninstalled it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent\n(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp \n$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the \ndirectory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in\nthat directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably \nleaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \nthe path.)\n\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\n\t\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\n\t\t\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\n\t\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\n\n\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\n\n-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file\n   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\n\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can't find\n   it, run bldfamily(1).)\n\n-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a\n   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for\n   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.\n   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for\n   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work\n   for X11Rn.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones \n(oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  40)  How do I convert a \".snf\" font back to \".bdf\" font?\n\n\tA tool called \"snftobdf 1.4\" is part of the bdftools package, which is \navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from \ncrl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?\n\n\tder Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and \nproduces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be \nused as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can \nunderstand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools \nsuch as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail \nfrom mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]\n\tIn addition, the R5 program \"fstobdf\" can produce bdf for any font that\nthe R5 server has access to.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,\nbut rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to\nstandard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file \ncontrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is \nfor a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for \ncreating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers \nwhich do not use the MIT font scheme.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  43)  How do I add \".bdf\" fonts to my DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \".pcf\" format.\nYou can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc\nfont-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a\nperformance hit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)\nI want to be able to do something like this:\n\txclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave\n\n\tYou can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the \nsame depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because \nof this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since \nthere is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, \nneither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap \nconverter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a \nresource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for \nuse in many of its widgets, however.\n[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]\n\nHowever:\n\tA specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of \nthe xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick \n(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of \nimage formats as a pixmap.\n\n\tThe leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used \nby Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by\nAT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM \ndistribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write \nroutines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to\nallow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.

This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in\ncontrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.\n \n[thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]\n\nA set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups\n11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?\n\n\tGenerally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you\nwith the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly \nfrom MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in\nmit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]\n\n[Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  52)  Why do I get \"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\"?\n\n\tThis error, which typically goes on to say, \"widget 11004 vs. \nintrinsics 11003\" indicates that the header files you included when building \nyour program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking \nagainst was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.\n\tHowever, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the \nX11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW\nsystems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, \nand applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you\nhave seen.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?\n\n\tWebster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's\nDictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware\nthat these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster \nand gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.\n\t[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A\nWebster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu \n(129.79.254.192) in \"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\".]\n\tUnless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site\nwhich can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. \n\n\tHowever, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the\nlatest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file \nxwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and \nnon-availability of dictionary servers. \n\t\n[courtesy steve@UMIACS.UMD.EDU (Steve Miller) and mayer@hplabs.hp.com (Niels \nMayer) 11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?\n\n\tNo. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not \n\"public domain\", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X \ndistribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.\n\tContributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by\nindividual authors.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?\n\nThe Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the \nprevious release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility \nacross releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, \ndetails are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the \nnetwork also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the \nfile typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.\n\n[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]\n\nThe comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  57)!

Where can I get patches to X11R5?\n\n\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\n\n\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \ntheir source distributions of X11.\n\n\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\n\t\tsend fixes #\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\n\n\tHere are a few complications:\n\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \n\"5d\" separately\n\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]\n\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\n\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\n\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\n\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \npreviously was optional\n\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\nby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\n\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\n\n\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \nit a request, and it mails back the response.\n\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \nof the message.\n\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\n\n\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \nmore detailed version of this help file.\n\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \nrequests an index cannot request data.\n\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\n\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \nday's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out \nshortest-first.\n\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If \nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\nor\n        path bar!foo!frotz\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\n\n\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If \nyour mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to \n{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.\n\n[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  60)!

Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.\nIt's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.\n\nIn the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda.\nAlso, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.\n\nThey also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software\nengineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,\nand some stuff about comms.   \n\nThe PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and \nX Windows programming as well)\nanyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending\non your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.\n\nThe one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought\ninvaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -\nthis would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but\nwould enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough\ncourse.\n\nYes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMackem Ian."

Last year, the SUG 1991 disk\ncontained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries,\nalmost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net\npostings, priced at only $250.\n\nOur aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be\nproduced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added\nas possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk\nset, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second\navailable later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other\nuseful material not found on previous disks.\n\nThe SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains\na lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great\nservice to make it available right away to our members (and this\npricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per\ndisk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a\nSUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live\nwithin the US or $55 outside.\n\nThe SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used\nby PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a\ntotal of 543MB of material, including:\n\nX11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after\nthe initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0\ndistribution are included (109MB of material).

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n\t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n\t\t\t\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\n\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current\n   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any\n   yet.\n\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\n   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.\n\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\n   brought into memory.\n\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\n   xvt over xterm.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n\t\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n\t\t\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\n\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\n  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different\n  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  \n\n  e.g. (for twm) :\n      menu \"mouse settings\" {\n        \"Mouse Settings:\"\t\t\tf.title\n\t\"  Very Fast\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 7 10 &\"\n\t\"  Normal (Fast)\"\t\t\t! \"xset m 3 10 &\"\n\t\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\"\t! \"xset m default &\"\n\t\"  Glacial\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 0 10 &\"\n      }\n\nProgramming Thoughts\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of\n    things you can do.  Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\n    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the\n    same operation between client and server.\n\n  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received\n  the following confirmation...\n\n  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):\n    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big\n    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage\n    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This\n    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was\n    essential when I only had 8 MB.\n\n  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :\n    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as\n    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\n\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in\n    Issue 3 of The X Resource.\n\n    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992\n    conference proceedings.\n\n    This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.\n\n--------------\nAuthor & Notes\n--------------\n  This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)\n\n  Suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list\n  are gladly accepted.

The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window\nManager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat\nsimiliar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is.\nBut MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work\nwithout each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason,\nhe switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif,\nwhich is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit\nis IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and\nfeatures alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.\n\nYou cannot say \"A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer\" ONLY because they have the\nwheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete\ndifferent worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel\nat the same position as MS-W.\n\n--\n+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+\n| o |                \\\\\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o |\n| o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o |\n| o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o |\n+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,\nand a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination\nof Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the\ntoolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I\nhave little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result\nin significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which\nlooks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,\nbut the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not\nsignificantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks\npromising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm\nnot confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,\nand what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The\nother libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make\nsufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.\n\nAt this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in\nC, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited\nto my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body\ncomes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me\nno goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which\nleaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry\ndirections.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now\nthan to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both\nuseless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only\nlibrary I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending\nnearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause\nshort-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is\nunlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits\nat the high end of the J curve.\n\n- Brad\n-- \nBrad Daniels\t\t`\t|  \"If money can't buy happiness,\ndaniels@neosoft.com\t\t|   I guess I'll have to rent it.\"\nI don't work for NeoSoft, and\t|\t\t- Weird Al Yenkovic\ndon't speak for my employer.\t|"

Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting\n  (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come\n  out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for\n  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.\n  Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.\n  Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely\n  adopted.\n\n\t\t\t\tRegards,\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRichard Gooch...."

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for\n many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size\n and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard\n x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,\n bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)\n may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different\n line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of\n distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in\n the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek\n alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts\n can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device\n drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile\n format and renderer.\n\n The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.\n The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly\n granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without\n consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT\n object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it\n is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely\n available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed\n somewhere in the documentation for the package.\n\n We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of\n user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any\n published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,\n which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that\n as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the\n kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest\n in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only\n afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on\n those which help us get our work done.\n\n PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically\n without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub\n routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any\n modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the\n header file \"plplot.h\"; see the documentation for more details.\n\n The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of\n several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex\n plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to\n the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained\n there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.  \n\n At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n\n\t Unix:\tSunOS\n\t\t A/IX \n\t\t HP-UX\n\t\t Unicos\n\t\t DG/UX\n\t\t Ultrix\n\t\t SysV\n\t\t Linux\n\n\t Amiga/Exec\n\t MS-DOS\n\t OS/2\n\t NeXT\n\n For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:\n  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual\n  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.\n\n To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to\n plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.\n\n CREDITS\n -------\n\n PLPLOT is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to\n list all the contributors.   Those currently supporting and otherwise\n responsible for the package in its present form include:\n\n Maurice LeBrun\n Please send all comments, flames, patches, etc, to me.

You can generally tell the difference\njust by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,\nit's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're\nprobably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware\ncursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible\nthat the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually\nchecking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just \nthat.\n\nIn reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless\nof what the server returns.\n\n-joel"

You have to\nprovide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is\nCopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't\nmatch its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a\nborder-pixel, and the problem should go away.\n\nThere is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that\nCopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to\nXCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines\nCopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so\nyou are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib\nimplementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm\nnot entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tder Mouse\n\n\t\t\t\tmouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu"

For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS\nand Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.\n\nThat said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display\non a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port\nwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say\nyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could\nput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.\nYou could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to\nmix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could\nhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,\nor 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any\ncombination.\n\nBecause of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use\nof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different\nin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.\n\nThe reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12\nscreens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server\nthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,\nMAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,\nthis is 12.\n\nAs such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.\nX server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X\nI'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is\nnot the case.\n\nWe just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of\ncourse, I could say \"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\"\n-- \n----\nRusty Sanders, Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or...\n         ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!"

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\nitem in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care\nof rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the\nWindow is mapped.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\nis visible and mapped.

Anyone have any ideas ??  \n\nI expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network\nitself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have\nroughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell\nfile servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our\nEthernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each\nsegment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run\nwere very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.\n\nBut the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486\n33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have\n10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns\nbecause you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will\nattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time\nslice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.\n\nHaving said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\nin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\nthing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\nyou started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\nIt all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\nto see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\ndoing network things also...)\n-- \n       Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels\n Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com\n  BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK\n   Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!"

This makes it look\nugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that\nthe selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications\nare having to make do with it's colormap.\n\nThis is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have\nseen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.\nMy solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display\napplications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather\nthan in color (if this is an option for the application).\n\n - Doug Shaker\n\tvoice:\t415/572-0200\n\tfax:\t415/572-1300\n\temail:\tdshaker@qualix.com\n\tmail:\tQualix Group\n\t\t1900 S.

So, does anyone have any suggestions as to\nhow to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the\ncode to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,\nor has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.\n\tMany thanks in advance for any help.\n\n--\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\nBill Woodward        | wpwood@austin.ibm.com   <-- Try this first\nAIX Software Support | billw@aixwiz.austin.ibm.com  \nGraphics Group       | 512-838-2834\nI am the terror that flaps in the night."

When tvtwm\nstarts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an \"ssetroot\" after\ntvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a \"(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&\")\nYou can also use \"VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename\" or just\nVirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.\n\n> ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised\n>     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.\n\nDid you install the sunkbd patch?

Typing a <RET> while\nthe Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be \"Tek-term\") is\nactive makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus\nto the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the \nTek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of\nXterm.

This is certainly\n  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.\n  A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared\n  memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT\n  server.\n  I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which\n  yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc\n  IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for\n  animations.\n\n\t\t\t\tRegards,\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRichard Gooch...."

        "content": "I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.\nI am having the following 2 problems.\n\n(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like\n                /**/#This is a makefile\n        at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C\n        preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that\n        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the\n        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the\n        start of a directive. \n\n        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol\n        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines\n        that \"This\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my\n        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better\n        fix.\n\n(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular\n        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp\n        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.\n\nIf you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate\ninformation about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later\nversion of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's\nthat behave similarly?\n\nSince I do not have easy access to News, a response to\n'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated."

In this configuration, X windows\napplications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a\nsecond xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,\ngiving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.\n\n   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial\none references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier\ncolours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only\nopening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL\nX applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the\ncommand line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different\nfont (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the\ndefault xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose\nall of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the\nfonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font\ndirectories/hash-tables.\n\n   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different\nfont and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\n\nMore info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),\n       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.\n       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc."

Can anybody help me out?\n\nThe problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,\nand these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\n\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".\n\n>In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says \"For information\n>on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...\", this is so you\n>know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to\n>Vol. 4 it says, \"Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is\n>nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For\n>example, the translation:\n>\tShift<Key>q:\tquit()\n>will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as\n>the Shift key (and the q key).\n\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If\nyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\ntranslations.\n\n>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?\n\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it's not possible.  That's according to\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\n\n>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you\n>can't use XtInstallAccelerators().\n\nI can't think of a reason why not.\n\n>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of\n>case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one\n>menu entry.\n\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's\naccelerators on itself and all of its descendants with\nXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).\n\nFor example,\n\n  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade\n\t\t\t\t\t  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  - exitPushbutton\n\n  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O\n  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O\n  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q\n  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q\n\n  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\nYou have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you\ncan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then\nXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.\n\nI tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I\nused TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\ndescribed above should work.\n\n-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)"

When using\non-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep\nit from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they\nwere just about equal.\n\n  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous\nsizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your\napplication dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when\ndebugging SHM apps).\n\n  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.\nUltrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be\nattached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes\nXShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24\nbit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to\nsupport the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using\npixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to\nuse the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one\ncopies the info three times per redraw instead of one).\n\n  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a\nGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick\nwhatever feels fastest.\n\n  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)\n\n  )Rob"

As soon as the end-user specified\none, it would be active and automatically installed.\n\nTo get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like:\n\n\t*menuItem.accelerators: #override \\n\\\n\t\tCtrl<Key>M:\tfire() \\n\\\n\t\tShift<Key>L:\tfire() \\n\n\nThe accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would\nautomatically see a \"Ctrl M\" show up in your menuItem object.\n\nWhy in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different\nspecial cases depending on what type of widget you're dealing with?  There\nhas to be some reason.\n\nSorry for the political tone of this message...\n\n--\nTom LaStrange        toml@boulder.ParcPlace.COM"

If you read the man\n  pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment\n  only dies after all attachments are gone.\n  Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)\n  and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,\n  including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more\n  shared memory segment.\n  Terrible, but it works.\n\n\t\t\t\tRegards,\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRichard Gooch...."

Can someone help me?\n\nUnfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into\nemacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to\nchange the source code so that all of these special keys generated\ncharacter sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier\nstate as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \"ESC [ 1 B 7\" \nwould indicate that the \"HOME\" key was pressed, with the shift key\ndown.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such\nas \"shift-Return\".\n\nIf anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll\nhave to have the source available and be comfortable munging with\nit a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code\nin the source file \"x11term.c\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is \ninterested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got\nbigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about \nemacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods \nsomewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.\n\nNotes: \n\n * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create\n   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which \n   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.\n\n * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2\n   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are\n   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could \n   easily be adapted for anything else.\n\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+\n| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\///       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\XX/ -------+"

Otherwise you'll have\n    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string\n    instead of using convenient octal sequences.]\n\n    If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show\n    your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll\n    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out\n    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.\n    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence\n    in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...\n\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+\n| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\///       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\XX/ -------+"

        "subject": "Announcing tcpview: A Motif-based TCP/IP protocol analyzer",
        "content": "Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\n\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will\nneed Motif 1.1 or better.\n\nThe following files are available for anonymous ftp from \nftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking\n\ntcpview-1.0.tar.Z\ttcpview and tcpdump source code\ntcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z\tSun4 binaries\ntcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z\tDEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries\n\nWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:\n- easier interface\n- enhanced protocol decoding\n- hex display of frame\n- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt\n- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name\n- ethernet address host table\n- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames\n- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional\n\tprocessing.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1\n\nNew features:\n\nNow reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the \nfile type will be automatically detected.\n\nCan now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.\n\nThe hex format has been changed.\n\nNew time options have been added.\n\nOptions were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.\n\nBugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)\n\nNew flags:\n-R\tread Sniffer file.

        "subject": "How to see characterset from wchar_t",
        "content": "We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System.\nThe toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n\nfacility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's \nX11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit\nuses Xsi.\n\nOur toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.\nIn order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\nand application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\n\nWe need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters\nfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.\n\nWe could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used\nXsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the\nsource code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.\n\n\n//I18N.h\n// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-\n// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $\n\n#ifndef _I18N_H\n#define _I18N_H\n\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n\nextern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,\t/* IN */\n\t\t\t\t int wc_len,\t\t/* IN */\n\t\t\t\t char *buf,\t\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t\t int *buflen,\t\t/* IN/OUT */\n\t\t\t\t int *scanned_len,\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t\t char **charset);\t/* OUT */\nextern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);\nextern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);\n\n#endif /* _I18N_H */\n\n//I18N.cc\n/* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <X11/Xlibint.h>\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\n#include \"I18N.h\"\n\nextern \"C\" {\n#include <X11/wchar.h>\n#define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\n#define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs\n#define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid\n#include \"Xlocaleint.h\"\n#undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\n#undef _Xmbfscs\n#undef _Xmbctidtocsid\n    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,\n\t\t\t\t\t char*, int*, int*, int*);\n    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);\n    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);\n};\n\nint decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */\n\t\t\t  int wc_len,\t\t/* IN */\n\t\t\t  char *buf,\t\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t  int *buf_len,\t\t/* IN/OUT */\n\t\t\t  int *scanned_len,\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t  char **charset)\t/* OUT */\n{\n    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();\n    int ctid;\n    int status;\n    Charset *xcharset;\n    \n    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,\n\t\t\t\t       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);\n    if (status == Success) {\n\txcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));\n\t*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;\n    }\n    else\n\t*charset = NULL;\n    return status;\n}\n----------------\n\nAn included file above, \"Xlocaleint.h\", is also Xsi internal and we copied\nthe file to the toolkit directory and compiled.\n\nA serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on\nour HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.\n\nWhen we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,\nlink errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:\n    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)\n    _Xmbfscs (code)\n    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)\n    _XFallBackConvert (code)\n\nWe had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until\nHP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that\nbecause HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to \nknow how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used \nits internal functions. \n\nThe HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.\nWe observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are\nnot sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and\ntherefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not\nseem to lead us a solution.\n\nMy question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like\n'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check\ncharacter set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?\nIf it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we\nwant to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.\n\nIn order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery\nto judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for\nthe string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source \nfiles. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. \nAny help or comments would be highly appreciated.\n\nI also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area\neven if it is not HP's implementation.\n\nThank you.\n\n--\n\t\t\t\tTakeshi Inoue\n\t\t\t\tinoue@crd.yokogawa.co.jp\n\t\t\t\tYokogawa Electric Corporation\n\t\t\t\tOpen Systems Laboratory\t0422(52)5557"

In fact,\ndoing \"man X\" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:\n\n     The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used\n     when referring to this software:\n\n                                  X\n                           X Window System\n                             X Version 11\n                     X Window System, Version 11\n                                 X11\n\nThere is no such thing as \"X Windows\" or \"X Window\", despite the repeated\nmisuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something\nabout how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME\nof the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have \nto say?\n\nWith regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can\nbuy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both \nGraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11\nover serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)  \n\nNCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is\nNCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such \nsoftware packages available.\n\nX11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running\nX11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and \nis based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. \n\nIt seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there\nwill be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various \nsorts of hardware.\n\nFollowups directed to comp.windows.x\n--\n Matt Landau\t\t\tWaiting for a flash of enlightenment\n matt@centerline.com\t\t\t  in all this blood and thunder"

It was $995, last I heard.\n\nYou might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing\ndirect importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release\navailable for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in\nfunctionality.

But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.\nIn some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,\nin some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by \nPANEL_MAX_VALUE! \n\nAs I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls\nnumber of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't\nwork in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>\ncontains the following bit:\n\n\t/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,\n\t * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes\n\t */\n\tPANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL\t= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,\t\t\t 152),\n\tPANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH\t= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,\t\t 182),\n\nwhich gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.\nBut 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting\nthis attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.\n\nStrange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space\nin a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...\n\nCan someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,\nand clear this problem? \n\nAny help is very much appreciated.\n\nYuri\n\nyuri@uk.ac.hw.phy"

The three problems I see are:\n\n  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.\n  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.\n  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the\n     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.\n\nBeing more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these\nlimitations thwart many X clients?

This architecture extends to areas not\nusually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, and\nprinting.\n\nAndrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications: \nword processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the latter\ntwo are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the XR6 tape\nin December.)\n\nFred Hansen\nDirector, Andrew Consortium"

For example, incorrect\nEnglish constructs such as \"its raining\" or \"it's window id\" annoy me.\nHowever, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way\nthings really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS\nwas really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically\nsuperior as well!).\n\nOn a related topic, who is to say that \"color\" is more or less correct\nthan \"colour\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed\nto American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API\nterms such as \"XAllocColor\" and \"colormap\".\n\nIn a world that uses the term \"Windows\" to refer to Microsoft Windows,\nperhaps the time has come to accept \"X Windows\" as a valid term for X.\nI think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say,\n\"the X Window System\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it.\nUltimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate\npeople. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,\nsnappy, descriptive title (\"X\" is positively obscure) will help\nwhen dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a\nsoftware engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become\npopularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should\nbe called \"Microsoft Windows\" or \"the Microsoft Window System\" or\nhow about just plain \"Microsoft\"!\n\nTo summarise (or should that be \"summarize\") the point of this message:\nI think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than\nworrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system\n(or should that be \"windowing system\"). Whatever gets recognised is\nfine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what\ntrade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this\nconclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System.\n\n\n\t\t\tGerard O'Driscoll (gerard.odriscoll@dps.co.uk)\n\t\t\tDu Pont Pixel Systems Ltd."

All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting,\nthough only Consortium members will be able to vote.\n\nThis year's theme is \n\n\tApplication Construction by Non-Programmers\n\nMuch of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer\nconstruction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent\nUIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will\nconsider questions such as\n\tWhat is needed for application construction by non-programmers?\n\tCan we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?\n\tIs it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to\ncreate new widgets?\n\tShould widgets and applications be able to print themselves?\n\nYour participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate\non the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including\n\n\tapplications\n\texperience with users\n\tnew objects\n\treviews of and proposals for revision of \n\t\tinternal Andrew protocols\n\nWe expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would\nlike to do a demonstration.  \n\nPaper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993.\nAcceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.\n\nSend papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.\n\nFred Hansen\nDirector, Andrew Consortium"

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have\nbeen changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.\n\nThis is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will\nincorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support\nX11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.\n\nNote to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this\ndistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.\n\nHere is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,\nhas developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++\nclasses. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through\nmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library\nwas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.\nHowever, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only\nworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no\nlonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.\n\nI, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell \nbindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and\nenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the\ngeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).\n\nNEW RELEASE\n\nI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++\nbindings. \n\nThis release offers:\n\n- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support\n- Support for Xbae widgetset \n- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate\n  progress in an application.\n- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake\n\t\t     and its config files on your site. I have tried to\n\t\t     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable\n\t\t     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely\n\t\t     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you\n\t\t     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma\n\t\t     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude\n\t\t     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.\n- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)\n- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted\n  on Usenet.\n\nWHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS\n\nFtp:\n\nAnonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.\n\nNote:\n\nPlease be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large\nfiles during working hours.\n\nAlso note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this\nis an old version of the bindings.\n\nE-mail:\n\nThose who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by\ne-mail.\n\nREQUEST\n\nThose who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please\ncontact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of\nbugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). \n\nMORE INFORMATION \n\nContact me at \"rvloon@cv.ruu.nl\".\nIf you are desperate, then you can call me at\n+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands\ncall 030-506711).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-- \nRonald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference \n(rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice.\n3DCV Group, Utrecht |   \nThe Netherlands     | In practice however, there is."

It allows composite\nmultimedia objects to be built from media objects.\n\nSpecifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available\nin InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the\nsource code for the original classes (though several configuration\nfiles for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). \n \nCurrently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN\nworkstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.\n\nXavier has been tested in the following environments:\n\nSUN:\n  Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC\n  OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later\n  C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1\n\nNEC(EWS):\n  Machine : EWS4800/210,230\n  OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2\n  C++     : C++ Release3.1\n\nIt can be obtained via anonymous ftp from \n\n         interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/\n          (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)\n\nWe are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.\nIf you are interested, please contact\n               \n                   xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp. \n\nI will add your e-mail address to our list.\n\n[Reference]\no Rei Hamakawa, Hizekazu Sakagami, Jun Rekimoto:\n  Audio and Video Extension to Graphical Interface Toolkits,\n  The Third International Workshop on Network and Operating\n  System Support for Digital Audio and Video, San Diego, 1992\n\n***********************************************************************\n* _                                                                   *\n*  \\ \\      Rei Hamakawa (e-mail: rei@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp)               *\n*   |o|                                                               *\n*   |o|     C & C Systems Research Laboratories                       *\n*   |o| __  NEC Corporation                                           *\n*  O| || /  1-1, Miyazaki 4-Chome,      TEL : +81-44-856-2271         *\n*  O| || |  Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki,       FAX : +81-44-856-2232         *\n*  O| \\/ |  Kanagawa 216 JAPAN                                        *\n*    \\__/                                                             *\n***********************************************************************"

Referring to section 14.3, \n    one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.\n\n    When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1, \n    XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs \n    a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives \n    the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would \n    expect red_max to give the maximum gray value."

This doesn't mean that every window manager\nauthor in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and\nimplemented this at top priority.\n\nThe ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at\nstartup.

Since standard colormaps\ntypically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid\ndisplacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one\nCLUT.\n\nI don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible\ncolormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,\ncolormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the\nsame standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a\nfull color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's\ncalled under X11R5).\n\nIf you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default\ncolormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into\nthat colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one\nhw CLUT framebuffer.\n\nNow if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your\nclient, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window\nmanagers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?\n-- \n\n   -paul\tpmartz@dsd.es.com\n\t\tEvans & Sutherland"

        "content": "I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display\nhardware, but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat\ncommonplace, so I'm sending a net-feeler.\n\nI have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit\n720x280 display.  The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd |\nxwud), seems to be exactly what it should be.  However, the displayed\nversion of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is\nusing scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation, it\nseems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to\na word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which\nisn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in\nmit/server/include/servermd.h:\n\n----\n\n#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32\n#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD\t\t5\n#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD\t2\n\n---\n\nto:\n\n---\n\n#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16\n#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD\t\t4\n#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD\t2\n\n---\n\nWas not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either\n(a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being\nbuilt to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte\nboundries?\n\nI'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0.\n\nThanks\nBrian"

        "content": "These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these\nspecific questions.\n\n1.  If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method?\nMy choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a \nmodifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers\nin a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to\nget the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that\nwhen an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated\n(non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't\nseem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all \nO'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of \nthe Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier \nrequirements.\n\n2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right\nof my main window.  I want it at the same y coord, and their right/left\nsides touching.  What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window \nmanager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone\nwho has called XtMoveWidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move\nand seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y\nand seeing that it is now offset by the WM border.\n\nAny help would be most appreciated.\n\nDarcy\ndarcy_mccallum@mentorg.com"

However, this digitiser makes use of the serial\nport, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.\n\nThe HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from\ndevices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number).\nI shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input\ndevice in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I?\n\nWhat I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected\nto their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a\nspecific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation?\nDid you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are\nthere generic public domain device drivers around?

I\ndecided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling\nXDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are\nwaiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).\nI was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring\nthe standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis\nit was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString\nwas doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor\nwas called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating\nwas not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that\nsays you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.\nWe are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4.\n\n\n\n-- \nRegards, Martin\n\n   /\\/\\     :  Martin Visser - Electrical / Software Engineer \n  / / /\\    :  Engineering Technology Department\n / / /  \\   :  BHP Steel - Slab and Plate Products Division\n/ / / /\\ \\  :  P.O.

To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to\nthe sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its\napplication can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the\ninternet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory\n./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5\" diskette can be\nordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address\nbelow. \n\nThe base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the\nsame host.\n\nNote that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows\nAUIS to compile under AIX3.2.\n\n-----------\n\nThe Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment\non top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media\napplications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the\ncapability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that\nnot only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but\nalso  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,\nequations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can\nthemselves contain other objects, including text.\n\nAUIS has three components:\n\n    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set\n    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help\n    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell\n    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various\n    available types of objects. \n\n    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented\n    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein\n    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,\n    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as\n    easily as those that come with the system. \n\n    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface\n    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail\n    management strategies and implements many advanced  features\n    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of\n    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails\n    of related messages, and subscription management. It also\n    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and\n    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function\n    workstations. \n\nThe current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for\nthe new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards\nfor multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of\nthe Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new\neditors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.\n\n\nRemote Andrew Demo Service\n\nYou can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew\nDemo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11\nwindow system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate\nthrough the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System\nto browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and\nnewsgroups.\n\nTo get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the\nfollowing command on your machine:\n\n\tfinger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu\n\nThe service will give you further instructions.   \n\n\nMore information about Andrew is available from:\n\n    Information Requests\n    Andrew Consortium\n    Carnegie Mellon University\n    Smith Hall 106\n    5000 Forbes Avenue\n    Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n    USA\n    phone: +1-412-268-6710\n    fax: +1-412-682-6938\n    info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu\n\nContact info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu for additional information."

The rescale method invokes a \"fake\" Expose\nevent (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)\nto draw the data.\n\nQuest 1.\nWhen the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)\nI get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size\nis changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?\nAny suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?\n\nQuest 2.\nWhen the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events\nwhatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n\n\n-- \n====================================================================================\nSteve Kelley\tUMCP CS/UMIACS\t\t\tCaptain, I protest!\n\t\tskelley@umiacs.umd.edu\t\tI am *NOT* a merry man! - Worf"

        "content": "I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping\nis really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about\nthis problem........\n\n- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded\n  text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.\n  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting\n  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables\n  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,\n  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything\n  works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.\n  (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual\n   application, just in my sample code to make things easier)\n\t\n- I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up\n  to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do   \n  XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources\n  are set to japanese fonts.\n\n- Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially\n  created with UIL. \n\n\nThe problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting\nXmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable\nalternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)\n\nI have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone\nwants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not\nproperly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the\nsource to look at it is just a guess.\n\nPlease let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,\nor if you want the sample program.\n\nTHANKS!!!!!!!!\n\n- Susan \n\n  swalker@bbn.com\n  617-873-8190"

Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window\nis popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. \nAt this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.\n\nIf a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it\nneeds to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it\nthere.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow\nrequest that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The\nIntrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after\nwmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because\nthe request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the\nsame.)\n\nThe solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information\nin ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5\npublic fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in\ngorier details.\n\ns'marks\n\n-- \nStuart W.

To allow the execution\nXof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to\nXthe remote session.  If you omit\nX.IR command ,\nXthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The\nX.B rxterm\nXvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes\nX.I args\nXto the remote xterm as arguments.\nX.PP\nXShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local\nXmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote\nXmachine.\nX.PP\nXIf the name of the file from which\nX.B rx\nXis executed is anything other than ``rx,''\nX.B rx\nXtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command\nXto run on the remote host, using any\nX.I command\nXparameters as arguments for the remote command.\nX.PP\nXIf\nX.B rx\nXthinks you are using\nX.B xauth\nXbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or\nXto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization\nXkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use\nX.B xhost(1)\nXto grant access to the remote host.\nX.SH OPTIONS\nX.TP\nX.BI \\-l \" username\"\nXUse\nX.I username\nXas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence\nXof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username.\nX\nX.SH ENVIRONMENT\nXIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR,\nXXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,\nXand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the\nXremote username is different, or the remote host is off-site, in which\nXcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the\nXvariable RXENV.\nX.PP\nXThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified\nXa hostname as is needed.\nX.SH DIAGNOSTICS\nX.TP\nX.IB command \": don't recognise my name.\"\nX.B rx\nXcannot decode the name it has been called under.  In this case\nXit prints a warning message, and continues, as normal.\nX.TP\nX.B \"rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...]\"\nXThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it.\nX.SH AUTHOR\nXDuncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk>, July 1992\nX.br\nXOriginally based on a program with the same name from the\nX.B gwm\nXdistribution.

Especially when \nXit's only one of them.\nX.PP\nXSometimes quoting can get messed up.\nX.PP\nXIt's too easy to fool the smarts in\nX.B rx\nXto make it believe something that is not true, and fail because of it.\nX.PP\nXWhen\nX.B rx\nXuses\nX.B xhost\nXto grant access, the\nX.B xhost\nXcommand may fail silently.\nX.PP\nXIf\nX.B rx\nXtries to send to large a command to the remote machine, it will\nXlikely fail with a parse error from csh.

I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT. \nSo far I've drawn the following conclusions:\n\n1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs\n2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit\n3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one)\n4) tcl/tk is a little buggy\n5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info)\n6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product.\n7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money)\n8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work\n9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ?\n10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.\n\nI'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products.\n\nthanks \n\n---\n*\tBruce Trvalik  AOA-----------------*\n*       (617)864-0201   check your mind at the door - The Band That Time Forgot\n*\tmoose@aoa.utc.com\n*       aoa!moose@bbn.com"

If you really want Tom to reply\nyou should send mail to support@qdeck.com.\n\nA 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps\nethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on \nwhat you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances\nof some really nasty program like \"Smoking Clover\" would make the link \nuseless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly\nupdating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real\nworld, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.\n\nGoing by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have\nto share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.\n\n>>Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\n>>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\n>>thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\n>>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\n>\n>Hmmm.

What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?).\n>What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you\n>have few high peaks and then many low points?\n\nOur corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very\ngood predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth\nlinks that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they\noften use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database \nremotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always\nat this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview\nX and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having\na long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about\nhow you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.\n\nRunning Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.\nLet's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy\nand efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a\nlittle more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen\nthat was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server\nthat it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough\nmemory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network\ntraffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a \nsolid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite\neasily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send\nit back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw\nthat small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be \nrepainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits\nthat has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.\nIn reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts \nthat will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.\n\n>\n>\n>>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\n>>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\n>>doing network things also...)\n>>-- \n>\n>What do you mean by network things?

I am wondering how \n>good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these \n>images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.\n\nX was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's \npretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost\nas good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.\nWe intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver\nkeyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in\nno way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a \nlot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but\nwe are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications\ntell us.\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   |\n|         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\\  |\n|  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\\  |\n|   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\\  |\n|          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\\  |\n|    Pricing/Ordering info :  info@qdeck.com      _____///////////______\\  |\n|     Technical Questions  : support@qdeck.com    __/////////////_______\\  |\n|         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+"

If you have several hundred users who do\nwhat the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best.  Another is to\nhave your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager\nand the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.\n\nOur alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts,\nit runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the\nrest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set\nup as normal and inherited by everything.

Most application designers who want to\ndraw things in several different colors create a GC for\neach color during initialization, then pass the GC id in\neach drawing request.\n\nFor more information see Scheifler and Gettys's article\nin the 1986 ACM Transactions on Graphics."

Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information\nis associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_\na parameter to the drawing routines.\n\nSo, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of\nwidth 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do\n\nXDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2);\nXDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4);\n\nfor this effect.\n\nThis is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much\nmore efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters\nlike line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every\ndrawing call, so why do it for color ?

        "content": "Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists\n              ---------------------------------------------\n   \n   Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful\n   information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET\n   newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly,\n   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum\n   for SCO products in general.\n   \n   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO\n   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been\n   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt\n   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*\n   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.\n\n   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in\n   accordance with accepted procedure within \"biz\".  Given the content,\n   this change relocated the \"opendesktop\" newsgroup to a more proper place\n   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new \"announce\"\n   and \"general\" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former \"sco-list@uunet.uu.net\"\n   became \"scogen\" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.\n\n   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992\n   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific\n   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are\n   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy\n   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.\n   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to\n   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.\n\n   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion\n   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.\n   \n   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,\n   you are now able to subscribe to the following:\n   \n        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription\n        ---------                    -------------------------\n        biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca\n        biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca\n        biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca\n\tbiz.sco.sources\t\t\t<none>\n\tbiz.sco.binaries\t\t<none>\n\tbiz.sco.magazine\t     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca\n\n   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET\n   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news\n   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and\n   I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in\n   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.\n   If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive\n   biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.\n   \n   The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion\n   mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a\n   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.\n   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate\n   \"mailing list subscription\" address above, including in the message body:\n\n\tAdd: subscriber_address\t\t-eg-\n\tAdd: your_logname@site.do.main  -or-\n\tAdd: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname\n\n   Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know\n   major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled\n   the same way, simply substitute \"Delete:\" for \"Add:\", ensuring that\n   you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list\n   subscribers receive \"how to post to the mlist\" article submission\n   information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive\n   an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test\n   message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely\n   that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do\n   the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your\n   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list\n   subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have\n   with the site(s) feeding you.\n   \n   Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged\n   drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we\n   are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a\n   handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you,\n   please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site.\n\n   What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable):\n   \n   biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative\n                        postings relating to past, present, and future\n                        implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating\n                        environment and it's various bundled components.\n   \n   biz.sco.general:     Questions, answers and comments on SCO products\n                        in general, and of course resulting discussions.\n   \n   biz.sco.announce:    SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of\n\t\t\tinterest to current and future users of SCO products,\n\t\t\tand to SCO developers, resellers and distributors.\n                        (moderated, followups directed to biz.sco.general).\n\n   biz.sco.sources:\tSysV or BSD source code for useful programs and\n\t\t\tutilities, modified to compile and run with various\n\t\t\tincarnations of SCO Xenix, UNIX, and/or OpenDesktop.\n\n   biz.sco.binaries:\tBinary packages compiled from SCO compatible source\n\t\t\tcode, often from source posted in biz.sco.sources\n\t\t\tand often installable using the SCO \"custom\" utility.\n\n   biz.sco.magazine:\tInteraction between the SCO Magazine readers, \n\t\t\twriters and publishers.\n\n   You should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable\n   newsgroup.  For example, posting your ODT question to the \"general\"\n   newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being\n   saved in the public ODT archives.

Now, this is not so simple because some window managers\nslap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,\nso be sure to take that into account for further calculations.\n\nCalculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using\nXGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION.\nRemember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the\nwindows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAll of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the\nwindow-manager is using.\n\nNow, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate \nwhere you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on\nthe OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly).\n\nDISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code.  But\nI did get it working under several window managers correctly.  Feel free to\ncall or e-mail for further info.\n\n              -McGary\n\n-- \nMike D.

You could run\nmultiple windows programs within the one WinX window, and windows has\nways to automagically start winapps when you start windows, so in practice\nit's not really a major problem.

        "content": "I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing\n/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from:\n:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100\nto:\n:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85\n\nI determined that my 19\" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the\nactive screen area and dividing by resolution.\n\nHowever, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely.\nAfter some research, I believe this is caused by my applications\nrequesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize.  I believe\nthat X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics\nand displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my\npath, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but\nnot for the family I am using (Helvetica).\n\nI think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the\nresolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you\nexplicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the\nscaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command\n\nxfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).\n\nThe command  \n\nxfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).\nDespite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can\ngenerate an 85dpi font for me!

It's compatible with the\n    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,\n    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.\n    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.\n    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the\n    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.\n    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as\n    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.\n    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,\n    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.\n    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:\n\tSunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0\n\tSolaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0\n\tSolaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1\n\n    See Also:\n\tMixing X11 and OpenWindows\n\tWhere can I get it?\n\n@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?\n    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs\n    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography\n    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:\n\n    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;\n    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were\n    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,\n    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the\n    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in\n    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in\n    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a\n    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).\n    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably\n    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or\n    anything else that uses subclasses.\n    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]\n\n    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in\n    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help\n    migrate source code from SunView to XView.\t XView is often said to be\n    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.\n    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is\n    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).\n    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.\n    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the\n    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be\n    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.\n    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much\n    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.\n\n    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based\n    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the\n    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of\n    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.\n\n    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some\n    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to\n    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time\n    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.\n    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the\n    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.\n    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.\n\n    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++\n    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from\n    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify\n    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be\n    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the\n    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.\n    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of\n    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in\n    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).\n\n@ Where does Motif fit in?\n    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that\n    is being developed by OSF.\tIt has a `look and feel' reminiscent of\n    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-\n    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold\n    reasonably cheaply by OSF.\tAlthough Motif is currently available on\n    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly\n    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a\n    large installed base.\n    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif\n    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in\n    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.\n\n@ What is MoOLIT?\n    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between\n    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V\n    Release 4.2.\n    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677\n\n@ What about that Display PostScript thing?\n    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X\n    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed\n    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a\n    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously\n    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it\n    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less\n    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.\n    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;\n    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.\n    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS\n    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to\n    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.\n    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts\n    available, however)\n\nSubject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm\n\n@ What are olwm and olvwm?\n    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window\n    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows\n    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.\n\n    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.\n    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and\n    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.\n\n    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the\n    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the\n    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.\t You can\n    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This\n    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around\n    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm\n    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.\n    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib\n    directory; there are three patches).\n\n@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?\n    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use\n    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the\n    footers some windows use to display certain messages.\n\n    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus\n    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run\n    under olwm.\n    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:\n\tLeftTitleButton \"target\" = f.delete\n    where \"target\" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.\n    Alternatively, try\n\t# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm\n\tLeftTitleButton \":menu\" = f.menu \"OL.menu\"\n\n\tmenu \"OL.menu\" {\n\t    \"Quit\"         f.delete\n\t}\n\n    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title\n    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).\n\n    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).\n\nSubject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays\n\n@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?\n    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.\n    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.\n    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS\n    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes\n    pageview in particular.\n\n    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-\n    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)\n    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about\n    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.\n    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you\n    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's\n    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.\n\n\nSubject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows\n     \n@ What configuration files do I need to know about?\n\n    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc\n\n    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in\n    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to\n    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files\n    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.\n\n    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,\n    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.\n\n    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys\n\n    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,\n    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.\n    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files\n    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need\n    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an\n    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,\n    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's \"contool\" program so that\n    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.\n    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.\n\n    .Xdefaults\n\n    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,\n    it is a good idea to include at least:\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:\ttrue\n\t*Input: TRUE\n    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they\n    forget to ask for it.\n\n    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default\n    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.\n    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.\n\n    .startup.ps\n\n    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)\n    on startup.\t This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the\n    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change\n    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a\n    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up\n    at all or will get broken in strange ways.\tThe NeWS manual gives code\n    that is both incorrect and insufficient.\n    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.\n\n    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see\n    the man page for xset (\"man xset\", and \"xset -help\") for more information.\n\n    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of\n    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of\n    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for\n    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime\n    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to\n    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your\n    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...\n\n\t% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual\n\t% /IncludeDemos? false def\n\n\tUserProfile begin\n\t    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def\n\t    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def\n\t    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...\n\tend\n\n    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:\n\n\t/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\t/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\t/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\n\tClassRepeatKeys pop\t% force repeat.ps to autoload\n\n\tendpackage endpackage endpackage\n\n    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the\n    OpenWindows server like this:\n\t$ psh -i .startup.ps\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n\t$ psh -i\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n\t/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send\n\t%%% now press control-D\n\n    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make\n    the root window be \"retained\", so that a PostScript drawing on the\n    background won't be erased when you move windows:\n\tframbuffer /Retained true put\n    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used\n    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.\n    \n    See also:\n\tTrouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type\n\tTrouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults?\n\tEnvironment Variables\n\n@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?\n    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one\n    or two occasional surprises.  See also \"man 7 xview\" for a list of\n    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.\n\n    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings\n    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should\n    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this\n    in your .xinitrc:\n\n    if eval `svenv -env`\n    then\n\txmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3\"\n\tinput_from_defaults\n    else\n\txmodmap -e \"pointer = 3 2 1\"\n    fi\n\n\n@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?\n\n    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but\n    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.\n    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as\n    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system\n    run screenblank automatically.\n\nSubject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste\n\n@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?\n\n    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):\n    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button\n      in xterm\n    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly\n      XView manual gets this wrong)\n    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)\n\n    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste\n\n   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:\n    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY\n    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).\n    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.\n\n@ COPY/PASTE is boring.\t What short-cuts are available?\n\n    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:\n    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button\n    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined\n      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)\n    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.\n    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection\n    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-\n      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button\n    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse\n      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the\n      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).\n    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want\n      to drop the text\n    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show\n      that it's OK to drop things here\n    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.\tThis works in text fields of\n      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection\n    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that\n      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.\n\n@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?\n\n    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.\n    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when\n    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the\n    right of the insert point.\n\n\tMeta-i - include file\t    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)\n\n\tCtrl-a - start of line\t    Ctrl-< - back word\n\tCtrl-e - end of line\t    Ctrl-> - forward word\n\tCtrl-w - delete word\t    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line\n\tCtrl-Return - move to end/START of document\n\n    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default\n    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.\n\n@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?\t Where is it documented?\n\n    See the manual page for shelltool.\n\nSubject: Applications: Finding Out...\n    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,\n    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_\n    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.\n\n    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular\n    OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor\n    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full\n    product documentation.\n\n    SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which\n    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as\n    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.\n\n    There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists\n    a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a\n    copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a\n    faster reply.\n\nSubject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc.\n\n@ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?\n    Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.\n    If \"man cm_delete\" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under\n    Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.\n\n@ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?\n    The best way is:\n    $ cd\n    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .\n    $ chmod +w .textswrc\n    edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)\n    add the follwing:\n\tKEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER\n\tcat ~/.signature\n    (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)\n\n    Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.\n\n\n\nSubject: Fonts\n\n@ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts?\n    Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).\n    Or, Not Yet, in other words.\n\n    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.\n    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and\n    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is\n    interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the\n    Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on\n    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.\n\n    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably\n    other major foundries.\n\n    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.\n\n@ Improving font rendering time\n    Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as\n    fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes\n    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache\n    parameters.\t If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the\n    font cache size.\n\t$ psh -i\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you\n\tcurrentfontmem =\t% type this line ...\n\t300\t% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes\n\t1024 setfontmem\n\t% Just to check:\n\tcurrentfontmem =\n\t1024\n    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.

If you're\n    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of\n    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.\n\n@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?\n    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.\n    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output\n    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.\n    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.

These notes apply to\n    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with\n    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.\n\n    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.\tYou can intermix OpenWindows\n    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.\n    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.\n\n    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions\n    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a\n    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory\n    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have\n    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in\n    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead\n    of OpenWindows ones!\n\n    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11\n    library directory.\tThis doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with\n    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't\n    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although\n    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.\n\n    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't\n    /usr/openwin.\n\n    See Also:\n\tEnvironment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).\n\n@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found\n    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use\n\t     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib\n    If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use\n    ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for\n    /bin/sh; for csh it is different.\n\n@ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero\n    Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches\n    and install the patch.\n\n@ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me?\n    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.\tIt won't run under\n    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw\n    the PostScript text and pictures.\n    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0\n    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.\n    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace\n    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to\n    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)\n    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.\n    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with\n    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).\n\n@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?\n    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from\n    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z\n\n@ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?\n    It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties\n    Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.\n\n@ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool\n    Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also\n    works if you run command tool on a remote machine.\n    Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.\n\n@ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red!\n    Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be\n    selected via the keyboard.

Ftp, implementations, etc...\n\n    XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and\n    elsewhere.\n\n    MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form.\n\n    OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun, or you can get the source from\n    Interactive Systems Inc.  It is also included in some vendors' System V\n    Release 4 implementations, although that's not always the latest version.\n    The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures\n    is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0.\n    Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as\n    the windowing system for Solaris.\n\n    There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either\n    available now or in progress.  Unfortunately, none of them seem to\n    be available from anywhere.

These\n  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the\n  performance of your workstation.\n\n  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more\n  hardware is always even a necessity.\n\n  This \"FAQ\" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different\n  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X\n  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.\n\n  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must\n  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal\n  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many\n  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.\n\n  This document is specifically concerned with X.

IMHO, it contains a\n    well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm\n    unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.]\n\n-----------------\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n  0. Introduction & Administrivia\n  1. What about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n  2.

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n\t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n\t\t\t\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\n\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

I suspect that\n  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.\n  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.\n\n  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines\n  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),\n\t\t   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]\n\n1) Xvt\n   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :\n   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z\n\n   \"...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get\n   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as\n   xterm is rather a hog! \"\n\n   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current\n   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any\n   yet.\n\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\n   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.\n\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\n   brought into memory.\n\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\n   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.\n   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.\n   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,\n   relative speed of each\n\n2) mterm\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in\n     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.\n\n   \"I also have my own terminal emulator.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n\t\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n\t\t\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\n\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\n  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different\n  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  \n\n  e.g. (for twm) :\n      menu \"mouse settings\" {\n        \"Mouse Settings:\"\t\t\tf.title\n\t\"  Very Fast\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 7 10 &\"\n\t\"  Normal (Fast)\"\t\t\t! \"xset m 3 10 &\"\n\t\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\"\t! \"xset m default &\"\n\t\"  Glacial\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 0 10 &\"\n      }\n\nProgramming Thoughts\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of\n    things you can do.  Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\n    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the\n    same operation between client and server.\n\n  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received\n  the following confirmation...\n\n  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):\n    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big\n    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage\n    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This\n    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was\n    essential when I only had 8 MB.\n\n  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :\n    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as\n    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\n\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

        "content": "Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can\nhelp me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color,\nsay red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want\nto be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it\nis larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000.\n\nMy problem is this: when I resize the window, only the \"original\" part of the\nwindow that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else\nis a grey..the oval \"tries\" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that\nit WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in\nthe region that was the original size of the window when created.\n\nFor example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I\nresize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is\nis from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval\nonly shows up in that 200x200 area.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a \nre-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?\n\nSecond question:\nCould someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are???\n\nThanks,\nChris"

        "content": "Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and\nit seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and\ncan point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is:\nGiven a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the\ndata  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow\nlink), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the\npicture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture\nmight first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of\npixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square\nwould be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be\npainted.\n\nSince  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side\nof a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted\nas  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to\nbe a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a\nsmall  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the\nmagnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X\nserver  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to\nask that a \"filter\" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the\nonly  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process\n(\"Permission denied\" ;-), and have it open a local window?\n\nIt seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up\nsuch  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each\none by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.\nBut  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice\nto hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  I\nobviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool\navailable that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.\n\nOh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build\ndemos  that  can  show such things as \"If this were run across, say, a\n4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear.\"  Then  the\ncustomer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.\n\n-- \nIf the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would  now\ncost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times would\nexplode, killing all its passengers."

The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.\n  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or\n    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our\n    European friends.\n  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.\n  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring\n    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,\n    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).\n  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale \n    or color on a Color monitor.)\n  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that\n    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)\n  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution\n    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).\n\n    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people\n    are encouraged to use in other programs.\n\n    Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:\n        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n        appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n\n\nFrom the ghostscript README:\n\n*****************************************************\n* This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. *\n*****************************************************\n\n********\n******** An overview of Ghostscript ********\n********\n\nGhostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:\n\n        - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very\nclosely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and\n\n        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that\nimplement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive\noperations in the Ghostscript language.\n\nThe Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely\nin C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.\nCurrently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform\nfamilies:\n\n        - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible\n          graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;\n\n        - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,\n          release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,\n          Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;\n          H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX\n          running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;\n          Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;\n\n        - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;\n\n        - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler\n          version 3.1 or later is required).\n\n\n(Get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview.)\n\n-- \nTim Williams                                   COM: (703) 704-1685\nNight Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate  DSN: 654-1685\nAMSEL-RD-NV-VISPD (Williams)                   FAX: (703) 704-1705\nFt.

It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming\ninterface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.\nXm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the\nAthena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both\nenvironments without changes, although many nice features are only\navailable when using Motif.\nIn some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing\na ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it -\ndata of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated\nin rare cases.\n\nXm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to\nencapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many\nideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version,\nwhich provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications\n(in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and\na simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).\n\nTop level objects in Xm++:\n* 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout\n  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw\n* 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface\n  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this\n  distribution)\n\nControls (children of top level objects):\n'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton',\n'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'\n\nThe staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap\nformat) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.\n\nEvent handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects\nXt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.\n\n\nCommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides\ncomponents for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very\nsimplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system\n(research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a\nsoftware achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications\nwith multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).\nIf you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS\nPublications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be\nour paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of\nthe art' from 1991).\nCommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was\nused to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing\nprimitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to\nsupport bitmaps and some controls also.\nKnown problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always\nredraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an\nobject), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.\n\n\nAbout this first release:\n\nXm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here\nfor smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think\nI can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications\nfor any non-critical purposes.\nCommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will\nbe continued this year because we plan to use it for another research\nproject here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems\nto be stable and can be used for experimental applications.\n\nPlatforms: this release was compiled and tested on:\n  HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07\n  SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1\n  PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6\n\nCaution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T\nstandard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or\nabove (the next release will be tested with both compilers).\n\nWhere to get it:\n================\n\nI have uploaded it on: export.lcs.mit.edu as: /contrib/Xm++.0.5.tar.Z\n\n(send a mail, if you cannot find it there, e-mail addr. below)\n\nWhere to find more information:\n===============================\n\nthe .../doc directory contains\n   INSTALL - how to build the libraries and examples\n   README.GNU - problems and limitations when using gnu g++ (read!!)\n   usersGuide.txt - a tutorial how to use Xm++\n   reference.txt - a first try of a Xm++ class reference manual\n\nthe README files in the .../samples gives a brief description of\neach of the seven samples.\n\n\nXm++/CommonInteract is free software for any non-profit purposes,\nsee the file .../lib/COPYRIGHT for details.\n\nSend any comments, bug reports and donations :-) to the Author:\n\n    Bernhard Strassl\n    Vienna User Interface Group\n\tInstitute for Applied Computer Science and Information Systems\n    University of Vienna\n    Lenaugasse 2/8, A-1080 Wien, Austria\n\ne-mail: xmplus@ani.univie.ac.at"

You even get blinking text - ok, enough\nadvertising.\n\nI haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories\nI have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do\nwhat we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since\nxterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to\nX10).\n\nThe actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you\nprovide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the\ncursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.\nSince it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you \ndo anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just\nhave to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after\nit's mapped.\n\nAs for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export\nis still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new\nrelease for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.\nBut since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say\nwhoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.\n\nAs is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else \nthan a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line\nof code). I'll put this on export today.\n\nMichael\n--\nMichael Elbel, Digital-PCS GmbH, Muenchen, Germany - me@dude.pcs.com\nIntelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe - Mia\nFermentation fault (coors dumped)"

My vampire\n  program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote\n  command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth)\n\n     Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do\n  this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow\n  you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes\n  the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required.\n\n     The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also\n  pass environment variables, as well as the current directory.

It is then a matter of\n  an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information\n  from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly.\n    A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does\n  this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the\n  actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your\n  authorization.\n    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the\n  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or\n  stty'ing your terminal.\n\n  ---8<---\n  script for launching rlogin:\n    #!/bin/sh\n    # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:\n    if [ -n \"$DISPLAY\" ]; then\n      case \"$DISPLAY\" in\n        :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;\n      esac\n      TERM=\"$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`\"\n      export TERM\n    fi\n    rlogin $*\n  ---8<---\n  add to your .cshrc or .login\n    if ( $?TERM ) then\n      if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then\n        echo \"$TERM\" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge -\n        setenv DISPLAY `echo \"$TERM\" | cut '-d&' -f2`\n        setenv TERM    `echo \"$TERM\" | cut '-d&' -f1`\n      endif\n    endif\n  ---8<---\n  xterm command to use\n    xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname\n  ---8<---\n\n3/ NFS.\n     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.\n   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization\n   is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your\n   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means.

Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each\n  individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known\n  by others, nor should it be easy to determine.\n    A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give\n  the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone\n  who is asking.\n    This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill\n  I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave\n  up this method.

Jordan implemented the system\ndependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,\ncall it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include\nfile for your specific machine or operating system using the basic\nimplementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a \nOS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to\nreally implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically\nfor just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file\ntty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all\nit still is probably better to implement a include file for each and\nevery operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type\nof mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm\nsources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a \ncouple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the \n\"drivers\" actually included from the toplevel include file will be \ncompiled into emu.\n\nIt shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully\nrelies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux\nsystem available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest\nyou read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or\nquestions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately\nwe have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we \njust don't have access to that many different systems.\n\nMichael\n\n\n--\nMichael Elbel, Digital-PCS GmbH, Muenchen, Germany - me@dude.pcs.com\nIntelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe - Mia\nFermentation fault (coors dumped)"

Nineteen full\nand half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days\nprovide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor\nexhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what\nfolks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.\n\nSpeakers at Xhibition 93 include: \n\n  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, \n  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, \n  Doug Young, and many others.\n\nXhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional\nconferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of\ninterest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object\nManagement Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server\ntechnologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;\nand (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.\n\nWith the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing\napplications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a\nplayer as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many\ndesktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be\nevaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and\nsuppliers.\n\nThe mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information\nto the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference\nat Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide\nthe *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX\ndevelopers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has\nwhat you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is\nthe place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you\nwhat you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development\nKits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an\nXhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience\nis growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a\nconfusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of\nthe other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion.\n\n\n-Aub Harden\n Technical Program Manager\n harden@ics.com\n\n\n        X H I B I T I O N   The Conference and Trade\n         ******    *****    Show for Corporate\n        *      *       *    Software Development\n         ******     ***  \n             *         *    201 Broadway\n          ***     *****     Cambridge, MA  02139\n\n              Windows on Distributed Computing\n\n                 June 7 - 11,   San Jose, CA\n\n           xhibit@ics.com  uunet!ics.com!xhibit\n        Voice: (617) 621-0060  Fax: (617) 621-9555\n\n      Presented by Integrated Computer Solutions, Inc."

Actual measurements\n(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to\n20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is\nfiltered by the window manager as well as the applications and how\nmany processes are needed for each character.)\n\nWhile a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking\nprocess, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like\n10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase\nin overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working\nset.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many\nas 50.\n\nIf you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!\n\n\nNick Maclaren\nUniversity of Cambridge Computer Laboratory,\nNew Museums Site, Pembroke Street,\nCambridge CB2 3QG, England.\nEmail:  nmm1@cus.cam.ac.uk\nTel.:   +44 223 334761\nFax:    +44 223 334679"

Read on......\n---------------------------------------------------------\nBristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of\nits popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.\n\n\t\t\t    HyperHelp 3.0\n\t\t\t    -------------\nHyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context\nsensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one\nline function call, application developers can access the\nfull features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on\ntheir development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,\nproject, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.\nThis allows a documentation department to maintain a single\nset of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and\nOpen Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. \nAnd with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!\n\nNew features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character\nbased viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History\nwindow.\n\n\t\t\t     Xprinter 2.0\n\t\t\t     ------------\nXprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated\nprinter support to their existing/new X based applications\nvery easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the\ndisplay and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code\nfor drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for\nour demo and see Xprinter in action.\n\nIf you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support\nto your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier\nthis year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that\nresulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology\nfor UNIX SVR4.2.\n\n\nFeel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about\nHyperHelp and Xprinter. \n\nIf you have any questions or comments, send them to us at:\ninfo@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.\n\n\t\t\t\tHappy demoing,\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe staff at Bristol Technology"

The number of characters\nX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }\nX       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.\nX\nX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:\nX\nX---entry---\nXrule:\t1993\nXfix:\ty or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)\nXtitle:\ttitle of entry  \t\t    (see comments below)\nXentry:\tEntry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)\nXdate:\tDate/time of submission in UTC\t    (see comments below)\nXhost:\tMachine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested\nX\tUse tab indented lines if needed\nX---remark---\nX    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if\nX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a\nX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th\nX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.\nX---author---\nXname:\tyour name\nXorg:\tSchool/Company/Organization\nXaddr:\tpostal address\nX\tuse tab indented lines to continue\nX\tdon't forget to include the country\nXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.\nX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.\nXanon:\ty or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)\nX---info---\nXIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in\nXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info\nXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.\nX---build---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program\nXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting\nXfile must be 255 bytes or less.\nX---program---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode\nXinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.\nX---end---\nX\nX      Regarding the above format:\nX\nX\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*\nX\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.\nX\nX\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should\nX\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,\nX\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.\nX\nX\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect\nX\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() \nX\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\nX\nX\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\nX\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the \nX\t  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same \nX\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be \nX\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\nX\nX\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above \nX\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\nX\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\nX\t  Email message to the judges.\nX\nX\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless \nX\t  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.\nX\nX\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\nX\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\nX\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\nX\nX\t* The entry's remarks should include:\nX\t    - what this program does\nX\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\nX\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\nX\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\nX\t    - information about any ---data--- files\nX\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated\nX\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\nX\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\nX\nX\t* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain\nX\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\nX\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They \nX\t  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple \nX\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX\t   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX\t   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX\t       digit, followed by '.c'\nX\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not \nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX    \nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many \nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners \nX    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts.\nX\nX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)\nX\nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.\nX\nX    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentry\nX    program.

Xt Glossary\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\n\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\n  widgets or gadgets.\n\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Related FAQ's\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\n\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \ncomp.windows.x.  \n\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \nto comp.windows.x.motif.\n\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\n\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\n\nWhy don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.\n\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly\nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\non the visual being used.  \n\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\nbecause the basic information you need is available.

Which visual should an application use?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\nsuch).\n\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\nor just monochrome.\n\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above \nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\nshell.\n\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\n\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\nvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\n\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\nlist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among\nother things.\n\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\n\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\texit (0);\n\t}\n\nOne can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\noccur.  \n\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\n\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\ndifficult to maintain practices.\n\nTry the following code instead.\n\n\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n\n\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern void ExitCallback (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw,\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure,\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\n\t\t\t\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\n\t}\n\n\tBoolean\n\tExitWorkProc (closure)\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\n\t{\n\t\texit (0);\n\t\t/*NOTREACHED*/\n\t}\n\n\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\n\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\nnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\nOS's it is the poll() system call.\n\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\n\nIt's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\nreliable.  In particular:\n\n\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\n\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\n\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\n\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\n\n\t- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.\n\n\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\n\t  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing\n\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\n\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\n\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\n\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\n\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\n\t  been given the whole block).\n\n\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this\npoint I don't know.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective\nit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full\ndetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already\nfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may\nnot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which\nmeans its a 1000 pages.\n\nAsente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \"X Window System Toolkit, The\n\tComplete Programmer's Guide and Specification\", Digital Press,\n\t1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\n\tPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC\n\tDirect at 1-800-DIGITAL.\n\nThe other book I commonly recomend to novices is:\n\nYoung, Doug. \"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with\n\tXt (Motif Version),\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).\n\t(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)\n\nAnd of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.\nO'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt\nreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively\noverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it\nvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to\nother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related\ninformation.\n\nI read two periodicals, \"The X Resource\" and the \"The X Journal\".\nThese are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \"The X Resource\"\nis published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the\nMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no\nadvertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For\norders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial\nmatters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at\nmath.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in\n~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.\n\n\n\"The X Journal\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.\nThe articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical\naudience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an\nexpectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a\nfairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good\ncollection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call\n(908) 563-9033.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n14. What Widgets are available?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are three popular widget sets:\n\nAthena\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\n\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\n\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\nMotif\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\n\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\n\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\n\t  it is poorly implemented.\nOLIT\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\n\t  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by\n\t  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.\n\t  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\n\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\n\nXtra\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\n\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\n\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\n\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen\n\t  them so I can't comment.\nFWF\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\n\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\n\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\n\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\n\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\nXcu\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\n\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\n\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\n\t  widely used.\nXs\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\n\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\nXw\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\n\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\n\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\n\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\n\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\n\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\nXo\t- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you\n\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\n\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\n\nTbl\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif\n\t  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.\nPlots\t- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).\n\t  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t__________________________________________\n\tName\t\tLanguage\tVendor\n\t__________________________________________\n\tXview\t\tC\t\tSun\n\tOI\t\tC++\t\tParcPlace\n\tInterviews\tC++\t\tStanford\n\tTcl/tk\t\tC\t\tsprite.berkeley.edu\n\t__________________________________________\n\n\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\n\ttypdef struct\n\t{\t\n\t    String\tname;\n\t    long\tvalue;\n\t} Arg;\n\nand the code:\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\n\nexpands to\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\targ.name = \"name\";\n\targ.value = 3.2;\n\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\nhow to get around this?\n\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\n\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\n    } else { \\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\n    }\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\n\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\n\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\n\n    string to data type\n    data type to string\n    data type to data type\n\ni) string to data type\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\n\n\tName\t\tValue\n\t\"True\"\t\t1\n\t\"False\"\t\t0\n\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\n\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\n    of the converters.\n\nii) data type to string\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\n\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\n\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\n    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\n    that they are consistent.\n\niii) data type to data type\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\n    red, green and blue.\n\n\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\n\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\n\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\n    Display *dpy;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\n\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\nconverted value:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    unsigned int    size;\n    caddr_t         addr;\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\n\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\nreturn True.\n\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\n\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\n\t    { \\\n\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n\t      return False; \\\n\t    } \\\n\t  else \\\n\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n      return True;\n\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n\t  return False; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n      return True;\n\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\nconverter is being called properly.\n\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\n\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    XtAppContext context;\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\nXtSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\nused.\n\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\n\n    XtCacheNone\t\tDon't cache any converted values\n    XtCacheAll\t\tCache all converted values\n    XtCacheByDisplay\tCache converted values on a per display basis\n\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\n\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\n\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\n\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\n    XtAppContext context;\n    XrmValuePtr to;\n    XtPointer converter_data;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\n\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\nR5 distribution:\n\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\nand remove it from the application context.\n\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\nhappen 3 ways:\n\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\n\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\n\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\n\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\n\nI'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\n\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\nproblem.\n\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\ndemonstrates this:\n\n#include <setjmp.h>\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\n\nvoid\nXIOHandler (dpy)\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\n{\n\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\n\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n\t...\n\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\n\t\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\n}\n\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\npurpose it is adequate.\n\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\nconnect to a display.\n\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\n\n\t1. Args passed at creation time.\n\t2. Command line arguments.\n\t3. User's per host defaults file\n\t4. User's defaults file.\n\t5. User's per application default file.\n\t6. System wide per application default file.\n\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\n\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\n\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nbut most do not.\n\nA user may have many per application default files containing\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\nis found.\n\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\n\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\n\n\t%N\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\n\t\tapplication's class name.\n\t%T\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n\t\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\n\t%C\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\n\t%S\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\n\t%L\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n\t%l\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n\t%t\tThe territory part of the display's language string\n\t%c\tThe codeset part of the display's language string\n\nLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\nLet's consider another example. This time, let's set\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\n\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\n\nWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\nlike this:\n\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\n\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\nbatch of default settings.)\n\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\n\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\nguarantee the order of execution.\n\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\nlist.\n\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\nsays:\n\n \t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\n \tprocedure is to be appended.\"\n \nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\nlist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\n\n> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible\n> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core\n> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag\n> stays set to TRUE.\n\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\n\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\n\n> Is this a problem with \"mwm\" or is there something\n> else which needs to be done?\n\nYou'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\n\n> If the problem is \"mwm\", what is the fastest\n> way to determine if a window is iconified? \n\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\nsuggestions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can't.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\nhandled something like:\n\n\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t{\n\t\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\n\t\texit (1)\n\t}\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\n\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\n\telse\n\t\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\n\t++count;\n\nto be written as:\n\n\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\n\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\n\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\nstructure or copying a string:\n\n\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\n\t  char\t     *ptr;\n\t  char\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\n\n\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\t/* takes care of type casting */\n\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\n\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\n\n\t char\t      *ptr;\n\n\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\n\t /* ... */\n\t free (ptr);\n\nmay not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\n\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst, I'd recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey\nat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\n\n\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\n\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\n\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\n\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\n\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\n\tmalloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\n\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\n\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\n\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\n\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\n\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly\n\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\n\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\n\nAn alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\nmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\nfor more info)\n\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\nserver are asynchronous.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\nFor example:\n\n    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &\n    example% xwininfo -tree\n\t     <click in new xload window>\n\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\nof errant widgets.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\ntest the way a widget manages it's children, you can try\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\nof both.  It's a very clever idea.\n\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\nUnfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to\nyour application which is stopped.\n\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\nusing a command sequence like this:\n\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\n\tthismachine% gdb application\t# Your favorite debugger.\n\tor this:\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% gdb application\n\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\n\t(gdb) run ...\n\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\n\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\ndeal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \n\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\nyou won't get those events.\n\nFor example:\n\n\t...\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\n\t\t\t\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\n\t\t\t\t   &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\n\n\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\n\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\n\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\n\nwould never invoke the timeout.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\n\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\n``intuitive'' fashion.\n\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\n\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\nprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\nas it is based on Xt).\n\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\nconventions, for more details read the code.\n\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\nanyway.\n\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also\navailable on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.\n-- \nPete Ware\t\t\t\t\tware@cis.ohio-state.edu\nCIS Dept, Ohio State University\t\t\tw/ (614) 292-7318\n228 Bolz Hall, 2036 Neil Ave.\t\t\th/ (614) 538-0965\nColumbus, OH 43210"

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->\t\t      |\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |\nX    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |\nX    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.\t      |\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of\nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You\nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer\nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as\nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many\nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners\nX    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts.\nX\nX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)\nX\nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.\nX\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\t      |\nX    year.

The rules, and sometimes the contest Email\nX    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may\nX    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical\nX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not\nX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical\nX    closing date for contests are in early May.\nX\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\nX    year.

The first two years consisted of five subjects:\nSoftware Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 \nassembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and \nCommunication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group\ndiscussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).\nThe third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company \nfor a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special \nTravel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  \nThe fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering \n(C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing \nTheory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where \nstudents worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an \noutside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change \nsuddenly).\n \nIn the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and \nexams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a \n30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework \nassessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?\n\nBTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by\nHonours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying\nto sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). \n\nCheers,\n  Michael \n-- \n| Michael S. A.

Affected programs include rgb and \nthe server.\n\n\tThis is from the GCC manual:\n\n\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \n\tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\n\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \n\treference.\n\n\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\n\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.\n\n\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\n\t`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.\n\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \ncompilation flags.  \n\n\tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\n\t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \n\t\trgb/rgb.c\n\n\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args or\nreturn values:  \n\t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \n\t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. \nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \nharmless as they don't involve structs.\n\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \n\t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \n\tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\n\n\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do \nthis simple test:\n\n\t#include <sys/ioctl.h>\n\tSIOCGIFCONF\n\nRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of \ninterest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like \nwhitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your \nfixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc\nsources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are \nidentical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make \nsure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.  \n\n[courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?\nIn mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \"missing\" defines for \nCG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?\n\n\tThe R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add\nthese lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:\n        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)\n        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n\n\tHowever, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so \nreferences to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the \nImakefile.

While \nbuilding and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid \nlinking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those \ndistributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  \nIf you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that \nthe shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or \n/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked \nstatically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\n\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it\nattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.\nYou can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to\nmost C compilers).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)\n\nThis is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in \nX11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was \nremoved in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5\nlibraries only applied to the documented interface).  \n\nA workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4\nor OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.\n\n[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis \n(jpf@heliocentric.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\n\n\tThere is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)\nrunning under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using \nshared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\n\t1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system\nadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used\nby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security \nproblems at your site.\n\t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\n\t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths\nto the libraries.\n\n[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]\n\nThe R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the\nnewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid\nprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this \nmay cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. \nXload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\n\n\tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits \nanyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by \naccessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps\nmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console \ndisplay.

Although it is not \nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\n\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \nobvious.\n\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\nR5 versions are different.\n\n\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\n\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\nusing Imake to build X\n\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\n\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4\nguide to imake.\n\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\nFulton on an early version of Imake\n\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\nmail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\n\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNutt\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\n\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make \n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX \nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing to\nwrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The\nX Journal, issue 2:1.\n\t- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on\ndemystifying Imake.\n\t- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in \nsasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.\n\n[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\n\n\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier \nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\n\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\n\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\n\n\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a \nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XShapeQueryExtension\n\t_XShapeCombineMask\n\n\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\n\n\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \nlibraries.\n\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \nerror \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\n\n\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that \nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\nbe called.\n\n\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \n\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\n\t2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \n\n\tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\n\t\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \n11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under \nthe current version of X, I get this message:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XtScrollBarSetThumb\n\t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\n\t_XtTextReplace\n\n\tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition\nto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4\nrelease notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\n[10/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\n\n\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\ncalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\ncan use something like the following:\n\n        XWMHints wmhints;\n        ...\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\n        wmhints.input = True;\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\n\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.\n\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \nthis done. \n\n\tIf you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\n\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\n\n\tYou can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\nspoofed in any case. \n\tFor most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so \nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \nmanager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\n\t\n\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just \nthis one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \ndistributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]\n\n\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\n\n\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\n\t{\n\tArg args[3];\n\tint i;\n\tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */\n\ti=0;\n\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\n\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\n\t...\n\t}\n\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \ndeclaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem \ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.\n[11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\n\n\tYou're probably trying to use these functions from application code.\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\n\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \nwidgets' data becoming corrupted.\n\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \navoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\n\n\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\nthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\nWhat should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \ncreating a new widget.\n\n\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and\nthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.\n\tIn general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating \nindependently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other\ncallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be \nregistered can explicitly call other functions necessary.\n\n[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?\n\n\tXtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving\ndangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not \nactually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?\n\t\n\tIt is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,\nwhich has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer\nis set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \"yes\" answer, the code drops\nout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: \n\n\tvoid quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)\n\t{\n\t\tint             answer;\n\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Really Quit?\");\n\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Are You Really Positive?\");\n\t\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t\texit(0);\n                }\n\t}\n\n\tA more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether \nto overwrite it.\n\tThis is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and\nwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the\ncalling function.

Using a window id of NULL (\"no window\") could \ncreate the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() \nbefore attempting to use the window associated with a widget. \n\tNote that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, \nbut that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also \nwait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?\n\nThe BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of \nthe screen.

(It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the \nuser enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual \ndesktop.) Substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code \nshould work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):\n\n     unsigned long valuemask;\n     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\n\n     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */\n     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;\n     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |\n         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);\n     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);\n\n     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by\n        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */\n     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,\n         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,\n         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);\n\nwhere the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,\nparticularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than\n32767.\n\nWhen you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to\nnormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse\nevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not\nhave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.\n\nIn addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor \nresource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the\ncursor without blocking pointer events.\n\n[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller \n(argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\n\n\tAn X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which \ncontinue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its \nchildren are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X \nconnection to the display. \n\tWhat you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \n\t\tclose (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));\nto close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your \nexec.

If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which \nmight be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave\nthe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points\nout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to\nXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be\ncalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by \nXlib or Xt functions.\n\tYou can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt\nhandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which\nhas previously been added.\n\n\tNote: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly \nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse \n(converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 131)  What are these \"Xlib sequence lost\" errors?\n\n\tYou may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error \nhandler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or \nXlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\n\n\tIt's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input \nboth from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but \nwhich operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or \nthe other file descriptor.\n\tA solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,\nuse XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be \ncalled every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your \nprogram's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt \ncallback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only\nnon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\n\tMost input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an \ninput handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\n\tBe careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.\nYou will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.\nXtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is \ncalled whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is\nnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always \nready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning\nand read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost\nalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the \ntype of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your \nfunction to test whether there is new data:\n\t     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;\nBut, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a \nbusy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting \na timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.\n\n[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;\nOllie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?\n\n\tYou can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting\nthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget\nwhich should receive the event.\n\t If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use \nXtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you\navoid a round-trip to the server.\n\tDepending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call\nits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.\n\n[courtesy Mark A.

However, the \nwindow is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --\nuntil your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will \ngenerally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code \nwould appear after window was created and mapped:\n  while (!done)\n    {\n      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);\n      switch (the_event.type) {\n\tcase Expose:\t /* On expose events, redraw */\n\t\tXDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);\n\t\tbreak;\n\t...\n\t}\n    }\n\n\tNote that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't \nset up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background \ncolors, so this program could previously include this code:\n  ...\n  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */\n  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */\n  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,\n                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);\n  ...\n \nNote: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is \nblack and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 \nand the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be \nreversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.\n\nAlso note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong \nthing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for \nforeground and background.\n\nAnd also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program\nif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may\nnot yet have appeared.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?\n\n\tThe 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about\none of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A \nserver can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,\nunix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --\nthe 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available \nScreens on this particular Display connection.\n\tThe macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular\nScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one\nwhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.\n\tIn Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine \nthe Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.\n\t(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros\nwhich return characteristics of the Screen have \"Display\" in the names -- \nXDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)\n\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,\nset it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The \nwindow keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're \nsure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() \nto clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read \nback that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and \nit suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD \nand Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n\tNote that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a \n(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the\npixel/pixmap however it wants.

In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have\nseveral choices:\n\t- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to\nmake non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the\nareas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers \nsupport the extension.\n\t- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for\nparticular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note \nthat there is no X notion of a \"transparent color index\".\n\t- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny \nwindows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.\n\t- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent\nwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application\nwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors\nthat will appear properly.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see also\nThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this\nlast option]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?\n\n\tWhen using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a\nbackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing\noperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that\nthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually\nrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black\nand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical\ncoincidence will break.]\n\tIf you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be \nallocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen\npre-computed values.\n\tIf you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you \ncan take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics \ncontext) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over \nred, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. \nThis foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and \nblue.\n\n[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley \n(whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?\n\n\tMake sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.

If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) \nthe XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is \nusually black. \n\n[Thanks to Paul Asente, asente@adobe.com, 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 142)  Why can't my program get a standard colormap?\nI have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the \nstandard colormap, but it doesn't work. \n\n\tXGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does \nnot create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.\nUse xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.\n\n[1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? \n\n\tThe initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most\nservers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there \n-- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using\nXFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever \ncolor you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a \nmask).

I want to check whether\nthe window exists before doing anything with it.\n\n\tBecause X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window \nwould still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an\nevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the\nevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow \nerrors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will\nwork except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed \nand its ID reallocated to another window.\n\n[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?\n\n\tYes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,\nthe server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that \nknows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except\nfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].\n\tThe problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple \napplications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the\napplications' running on different machines) is in the first application to \ncreate a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into\nit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also\nknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.\n\t[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first\napplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned\nin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]\n\tNote also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level \ncooperation among your applications. \n\tNote also that two processes can share a window but should not try to \nuse the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it \nshould close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.\n\n[mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?\n\n\tA number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not\nhandle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return \nthe wrong child of root.

You can try setting \nthe minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. \n[1/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?\n\n\tIt's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself\n[e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- \nimagine the conflict between two such programs running.  \n\tThe only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack\nis to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily\nassuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do \nthis infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup \nmenus or other short parameter-setting windows).\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?\n\n\tThere is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of\nextension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,\neither by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games\nwith the colormap and changing the color of the contents.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?\n\n\tUsers of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help \nget notification of double-clicking.\n\tThere is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the \nprotocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do \nclient-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer\nactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you \nhave to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish \nimplementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of \nthe X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.\n\tNote that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click\nbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case\nin your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise\ncheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should\nbe the single-click action or the double-click action.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?\n\t\n\tXlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics \ncapabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics\nlibraries.\n\tYour only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to\nrender the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \"by \nhand\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via \nXPutImage(); more specifically:\n\t1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.\n\t2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).\n\t3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.\n\t4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where \n\t\ta = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)\n\t\tb = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\n\t5) render I2\n\tNote that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose\nbits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.\n\tThe high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X \nalso permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,\nalthough most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the\nsame fonts that would be found on a printer.\n\tIn addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font\non it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some\npredefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each\nglyph.\n\n[courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu), Eric Taylor \n(etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;\nLiam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]\n\n\tInterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for\nrendering rotated fonts in X.

The more specific you\nare, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without\nall the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are\nable to respond at all.\n\n\tAlways mention what version of X you are using and where you got it \nfrom. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,\ngive details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S \nversion for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to \nmention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.\n\n\tThen tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what\nyou expected/wanted to happen.

(How do I write X-friendly applications?)\n\n\tThe Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the \nofficial X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It \ndescribes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with \nother clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need \nto read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the \nselection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window \nmanager.  Get it either:\n\t- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT\n\t- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \"X Window System\" book\n\t- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \"X Protocol\nReference Manual.\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.\n\tThe version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to \nthe efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the \npresentation.\n\n[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]\n\n\t- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's\n\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\". The complete document is on the R5\ntapes.\n\n\tAlternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \"RTFM\" and is\nthe most-important of the least-read X documents.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?\n\n\tThe MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the\ndevelopment of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of \ncooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software \ninterfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.\n\tMIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and \nadministrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the \nConsortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, \nMember (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).\n\tMost of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, \nwith meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,\ninterest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  \nTypically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with \nothers acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification\nis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium\nas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public \nreview (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.\n\tYour involvement in the public review process or as a Member or \nAffiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.\n\tWrite to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer \nScience, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.\n\n[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4\ndistribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?\n\n\tOPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK\nwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was\ndeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF \nmembers. \n\n\tOPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; \nthere are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.\nMotif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the \none from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce \nprograms which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's \n(formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \"virtual toolkit\" which provides objects in the\nstyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.\n\n\tOPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising \ntheir OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.\n\n[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?\n\n\tOpen Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system \nthat combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface \nspecification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including\nthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and\na number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).\n\n[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?\n\n\tDECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI \ntoolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a \nsession manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, \ndxpsview, etc.).\n\n(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)\n[8/90] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  15)  What is PEX?\n\n\tPEX is the \"PHiGS Extension to X\".\n\tPHiGS stands for \"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics \nSystem\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation \nand manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in \nhardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension \nallows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized \nhardware for 3D graphics.\n\tSun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely \nredistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample\nimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \ntheir workstations and X terminals.\n\n[last modified 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\n\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\n\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \n\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do \nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\n\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\n\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \npseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\n   (1)\tYou don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't \n\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \n\tconnected), and\n   (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\n\thave to cross the serial interface, and\n   (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \n\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \n\tblocks to compress.\n\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \nNCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \nimplementation available in R6.\n\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\nin contrib/ in the following files:\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\n\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\n\n\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\n\n\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\n\n\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\n\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\n\ttwm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\nre-parenting window manager. \n\tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\n\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \n\trtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\n\tdxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\n\thpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\n\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\n\ttekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering \n\tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\nGuide functionality\n\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\n\tgwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\n\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\n\tpswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\n\tswm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\nfrom the resources file\n\ttwm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\n\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \nfrom export. [3/92]\n\ttvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\navailable on archive servers\n\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is \navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\n\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\n\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \n\tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals \n\tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\n\tvuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\n\t4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM\n\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\n\n\tIt needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\n\t\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\n\n\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \nLook for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are \nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\n[10/90]\n\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the \nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\napplications and the resource database. \n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?\n\n\tDEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\n\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\n\n\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The X\nprotocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\na capability not supported by all systems.\n\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \nfrom MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the \nkeyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\n\n\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \ndoes not do \"macro expansion.\"\n\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \naccept a translation resource such as:\n\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\n\t\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\ncharacters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\ncontrol character you want to include.\n\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\nhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?\n\n\tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window \nor the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. \nThe file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr \nclient and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\n\t\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an\nundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the \ncommand-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for \nspecifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\n\n\tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of \narbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.\nThere are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]\nis the most recent.\n\txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders \nXPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;\nsee xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.\n\tA screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr\nis available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: \nsoft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.\n\txprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available\nfrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.\n\n\tTo post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,\nwhich is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps\nand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for \nuse in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and\ncontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive\nservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\n\n\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and\nsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\n\n\tAlso: \n\n\tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter \n2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net\nin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\n\n\tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-\ncapture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and \nnon-PostScript printers.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) \ninclude session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portion\nof screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which \ncan be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, \nhave a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals \nhave local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct \nsupport for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package \nto massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\n\n\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \n\t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color \nPostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \n\t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.\nYou can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick \ndistribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\n\n\tThis can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider \ninstead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?\n\n\tThe likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ \nPortable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting \namong various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, \ngray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\n\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in \nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\nIt's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\n\n\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \nGraeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\n\n\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \nit, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; \nsee the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\n\tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.\nConversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available\nvia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, \nand ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\n\n\tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads\nand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image\nmanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as\ncontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\n\n\tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar \nto PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, \nweedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.\n\n\tXim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential \ninteractive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is \na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\n\n\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \nexport's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\n\n\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\nas part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x.

The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version\nof the control sequences. [1/93]\n\nOther good sources of information include the R4 version of that document\nand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a \ncompilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 \nsequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was \npublished in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).\n\nIn a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.\n\n[last updated 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?\n\n\tIn order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to \n\"stty pass8\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as \n\tXTerm*font: \t-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n\tXTerm*boldfont:\t-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]\n\nIn addition, you may want to set this in your shell:\n\tsetenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1\n\n        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with \nthe Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using\n`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') \nis Alt-'. \n\n[thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea \n(gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?\n\n\tYou are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give \na resource specification like this:\n\t\txterm*geometry: 80x24\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \nBut its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\n\t\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\n\n\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \n\t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\n\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\nadapted to do this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\n\n\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\n\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also \nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \nXtResolvePathname()):\n\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\n                application's class name.\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n        %t      The territory part of the display's language string\n        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string\n\n\tLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\n\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\n\tLet's consider another example. This time, let's set \nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\n\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \nMyterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\n%S are useless.\n\n\tWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization \nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\n\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\n\n\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\nthis batch of default settings.)\n\n\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory \nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\n\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \nby a slash.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\n\nThe answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \n\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \n\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\n\t#!/bin/sh\n\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a \ngeneral hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.\n\n[Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?\n\n\tWhen xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login\nfiles. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;\nor you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and\nsource it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,\nif you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your \n.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting\nyour .xsession file off with \"#!/bin/csh\". \n\tIf this doesn't work, also try starting off with:\n\t\t#!/bin/sh\n\t\t# Reset path:\n\t\tPATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?\n\n\tThere are several ways to avoid having to do a \"setenv DISPLAY ...\"\nwhenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.\n\tOne solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It \nincludes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and\nxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.\nA more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.\n\tOne solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse\n(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from\n132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and\n$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then \npropagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\n\t\teval `xrlogind`\nwhere xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special \nformat it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to \nrecreate the environment variables. [11/90]\n\n\tIn addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on \nanother host, and you find\n\t\trsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY \ntoo simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh \ncan be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be \n\t\txrsh <HOST> xterm\n\n  #! /bin/sh\n  # start an X11 process on another host\n  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT\n  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>\n  # rsh $host -n \"setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null\"\n  #\n  # An improved version:\n  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)\n  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)\n  #\n  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X \nJournal for more information.\n\tThe R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained \na number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format\nand a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.\n\tAn easier way is to use the \"xfed\" client to modify an existing font; a\nversion is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is \navailable for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], \npossibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce\nBDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.\n\tThe xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,\nXPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in\n/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed \n[5/91] in export:/contrib. \n\tIf you are a MetaFont user you can use \"mftobdf\" from the SeeTeX\ndistribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution\nis on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\tThe GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,\na font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.\n\tThe O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these\ntools to modify a font.\n\tFonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is\nin ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?\n\n\tAfter you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, \ninstalled it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent\n(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp \n$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the \ndirectory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in\nthat directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably \nleaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \nthe path.)\n\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\n\t\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\n\t\t\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\n\t\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\n\n\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\n\n-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file\n   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\n\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can't find\n   it, run bldfamily(1).)\n\n-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a\n   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for\n   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.\n   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for\n   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work\n   for X11Rn.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones \n(oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  40)  How do I convert a \".snf\" font back to \".bdf\" font?\n\n\tA tool called \"snftobdf 1.4\" is part of the bdftools package, which is \navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from \ncrl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?\n\n\tder Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and \nproduces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be \nused as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can \nunderstand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools \nsuch as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail \nfrom mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]\n\tIn addition, the R5 program \"fstobdf\" can produce bdf for any font that\nthe R5 server has access to.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,\nbut rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to\nstandard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file \ncontrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is \nfor a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for \ncreating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers \nwhich do not use the MIT font scheme.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  43)  How do I add \".bdf\" fonts to my DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \".pcf\" format.\nYou can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc\nfont-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a\nperformance hit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)\nI want to be able to do something like this:\n\txclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave\n\n\tYou can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the \nsame depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because \nof this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since \nthere is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, \nneither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap \nconverter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a \nresource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for \nuse in many of its widgets, however.\n[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]\n\nHowever:\n\tA specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of \nthe xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick \n(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of \nimage formats as a pixmap.\n\n\tThe leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used \nby Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by\nAT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM \ndistribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write \nroutines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to\nallow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.

This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in\ncontrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.\n \n[thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]\n\nA set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups\n11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?\n\n\tGenerally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you\nwith the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly \nfrom MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in\nmit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]\n\n[Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  52)  Why do I get \"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\"?\n\n\tThis error, which typically goes on to say, \"widget 11004 vs. \nintrinsics 11003\" indicates that the header files you included when building \nyour program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking \nagainst was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.\n\tHowever, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the \nX11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW\nsystems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, \nand applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you\nhave seen.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?\n\n\tWebster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's\nDictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware\nthat these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster \nand gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.\n\t[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A\nWebster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu \n(129.79.254.192) in \"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\".]\n\tUnless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site\nwhich can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. \n\n\tHowever, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the\nlatest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file \nxwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and \nnon-availability of dictionary servers. \n\t\n[courtesy steve@UMIACS.UMD.EDU (Steve Miller) and mayer@hplabs.hp.com (Niels \nMayer) 11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?\n\n\tNo. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not \n\"public domain\", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X \ndistribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.\n\tContributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by\nindividual authors.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?\n\nThe Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the \nprevious release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility \nacross releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, \ndetails are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the \nnetwork also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the \nfile typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.\n\n[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]\n\nThe comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  57)!

Where can I get patches to X11R5?\n\n\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\n\n\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \ntheir source distributions of X11.\n\n\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\n\t\tsend fixes #\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\n\n\tHere are a few complications:\n\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \n\"5d\" separately\n\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]\n\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\n\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\n\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\n\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \npreviously was optional\n\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\nby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\n\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\n\n\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \nit a request, and it mails back the response.\n\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \nof the message.\n\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\n\n\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \nmore detailed version of this help file.\n\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \nrequests an index cannot request data.\n\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\n\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \nday's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out \nshortest-first.\n\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If \nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\nor\n        path bar!foo!frotz\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\n\n\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If \nyour mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to \n{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.\n\n[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  60)!

Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.\nIt's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.\n\nIn the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda.\nAlso, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.\n\nThey also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software\nengineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,\nand some stuff about comms.   \n\nThe PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and \nX Windows programming as well)\nanyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending\non your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.\n\nThe one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought\ninvaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -\nthis would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but\nwould enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough\ncourse.\n\nYes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMackem Ian."

Last year, the SUG 1991 disk\ncontained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries,\nalmost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net\npostings, priced at only $250.\n\nOur aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be\nproduced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added\nas possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk\nset, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second\navailable later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other\nuseful material not found on previous disks.\n\nThe SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains\na lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great\nservice to make it available right away to our members (and this\npricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per\ndisk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a\nSUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live\nwithin the US or $55 outside.\n\nThe SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used\nby PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a\ntotal of 543MB of material, including:\n\nX11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after\nthe initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0\ndistribution are included (109MB of material).

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n\t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n\t\t\t\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\n\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

[ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),\n\t\t   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]\n\n1) Xvt\n   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :\n   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z\n\n   \"...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get\n   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as\n   xterm is rather a hog! \"\n\n   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current\n   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any\n   yet.\n\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\n   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.\n\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\n   brought into memory.\n\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\n   xvt over xterm.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n\t\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n\t\t\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\n\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\n  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different\n  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  \n\n  e.g. (for twm) :\n      menu \"mouse settings\" {\n        \"Mouse Settings:\"\t\t\tf.title\n\t\"  Very Fast\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 7 10 &\"\n\t\"  Normal (Fast)\"\t\t\t! \"xset m 3 10 &\"\n\t\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\"\t! \"xset m default &\"\n\t\"  Glacial\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 0 10 &\"\n      }\n\nProgramming Thoughts\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of\n    things you can do.  Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\n    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the\n    same operation between client and server.\n\n  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received\n  the following confirmation...\n\n  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):\n    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big\n    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage\n    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This\n    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was\n    essential when I only had 8 MB.\n\n  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :\n    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as\n    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\n\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in\n    Issue 3 of The X Resource.\n\n    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992\n    conference proceedings.\n\n    This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.\n\n--------------\nAuthor & Notes\n--------------\n  This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)\n\n  Suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list\n  are gladly accepted.

The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window\nManager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat\nsimiliar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is.\nBut MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work\nwithout each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason,\nhe switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif,\nwhich is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit\nis IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and\nfeatures alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.\n\nYou cannot say \"A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer\" ONLY because they have the\nwheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete\ndifferent worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel\nat the same position as MS-W.\n\n--\n+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+\n| o |                \\\\\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o |\n| o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o |\n| o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o |\n+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,\nand a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination\nof Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the\ntoolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I\nhave little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result\nin significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which\nlooks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,\nbut the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not\nsignificantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks\npromising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm\nnot confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,\nand what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The\nother libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make\nsufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.\n\nAt this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in\nC, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited\nto my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body\ncomes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me\nno goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which\nleaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry\ndirections.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now\nthan to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both\nuseless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only\nlibrary I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending\nnearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause\nshort-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is\nunlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits\nat the high end of the J curve.\n\n- Brad\n-- \nBrad Daniels\t\t`\t|  \"If money can't buy happiness,\ndaniels@neosoft.com\t\t|   I guess I'll have to rent it.\"\nI don't work for NeoSoft, and\t|\t\t- Weird Al Yenkovic\ndon't speak for my employer.\t|"

Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting\n  (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come\n  out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for\n  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.\n  Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.\n  Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely\n  adopted.\n\n\t\t\t\tRegards,\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRichard Gooch...."

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for\n many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size\n and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard\n x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,\n bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)\n may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different\n line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of\n distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in\n the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek\n alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts\n can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device\n drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile\n format and renderer.\n\n The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.\n The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly\n granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without\n consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT\n object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it\n is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely\n available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed\n somewhere in the documentation for the package.\n\n We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of\n user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any\n published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,\n which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that\n as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the\n kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest\n in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only\n afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on\n those which help us get our work done.\n\n PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically\n without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub\n routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any\n modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the\n header file \"plplot.h\"; see the documentation for more details.\n\n The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of\n several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex\n plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to\n the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained\n there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.  \n\n At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n\n\t Unix:\tSunOS\n\t\t A/IX \n\t\t HP-UX\n\t\t Unicos\n\t\t DG/UX\n\t\t Ultrix\n\t\t SysV\n\t\t Linux\n\n\t Amiga/Exec\n\t MS-DOS\n\t OS/2\n\t NeXT\n\n For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:\n  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual\n  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.\n\n To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to\n plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.\n\n CREDITS\n -------\n\n PLPLOT is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to\n list all the contributors.   Those currently supporting and otherwise\n responsible for the package in its present form include:\n\n Maurice LeBrun\n Please send all comments, flames, patches, etc, to me.

You can generally tell the difference\njust by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,\nit's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're\nprobably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware\ncursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible\nthat the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually\nchecking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just \nthat.\n\nIn reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless\nof what the server returns.\n\n-joel"

I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not\nseen it myself).\n\n  Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which\nonly three came with Motif.

I anticipate having this same\nproblem when X11R6 becomes available.\n\n  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do\nnot have Motif compiled under X11R5.

You have to\nprovide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is\nCopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't\nmatch its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a\nborder-pixel, and the problem should go away.\n\nThere is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that\nCopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to\nXCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines\nCopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so\nyou are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib\nimplementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm\nnot entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tder Mouse\n\n\t\t\t\tmouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu"

For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS\nand Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.\n\nThat said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display\non a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port\nwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say\nyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could\nput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.\nYou could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to\nmix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could\nhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,\nor 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any\ncombination.\n\nBecause of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use\nof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different\nin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.\n\nThe reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12\nscreens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server\nthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,\nMAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,\nthis is 12.\n\nAs such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.\nX server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X\nI'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is\nnot the case.\n\nWe just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of\ncourse, I could say \"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\"\n-- \n----\nRusty Sanders, Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or...\n         ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!"

Alternately\nyou can set window manager hints.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\nitem in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care\nof rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the\nWindow is mapped.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\nis visible and mapped.

Anyone have any ideas ??  \n\nI expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network\nitself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have\nroughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell\nfile servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our\nEthernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each\nsegment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run\nwere very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.\n\nBut the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486\n33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have\n10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns\nbecause you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will\nattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time\nslice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.\n\nHaving said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\nin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\nthing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\nyou started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\nIt all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\nto see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\ndoing network things also...)\n-- \n       Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels\n Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com\n  BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK\n   Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!"

This makes it look\nugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that\nthe selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications\nare having to make do with it's colormap.\n\nThis is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have\nseen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.\nMy solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display\napplications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather\nthan in color (if this is an option for the application).\n\n - Doug Shaker\n\tvoice:\t415/572-0200\n\tfax:\t415/572-1300\n\temail:\tdshaker@qualix.com\n\tmail:\tQualix Group\n\t\t1900 S.

I mentioned\nI was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional\ncomments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into. \n \n Send your comments/wish-list, raving, et. al. about DevGuide to:\n\n  Tali.Aben@Sun.COM\n\n\n Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of this\nand computers may have a future.\n\n Frankly, I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability\nto DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability, pointed out in March's \nSunExpert magazine. \n\n Technology works, we can crankout the interfaces with DevGuide.

When tvtwm\nstarts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an \"ssetroot\" after\ntvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a \"(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&\")\nYou can also use \"VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename\" or just\nVirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.\n\n> ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised\n>     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.\n\nDid you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export.\nAll the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following:\nThe End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized.\nEven the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed\ncharacters in an xterm to get passed.)\n\nAnyone have a fix for the last two?\n\n--Dave\n-- \nSystem Administrator, Penn State Population Research Institute\n* Dog Dianetics (\"Woof woof woof?

Typing a <RET> while\nthe Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be \"Tek-term\") is\nactive makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus\nto the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the \nTek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of\nXterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  \n\nThe xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.\n\nSubsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics \nhighlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move \nthe Tek-term to the top.

This is certainly\n  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.\n  A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared\n  memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT\n  server.\n  I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which\n  yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc\n  IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for\n  animations.\n\n\t\t\t\tRegards,\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRichard Gooch...."

The interesting thing\nto me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -\na Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a\nSun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on\nNCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. \nActually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root\nwinodw are gladly returned as OK.

In the demo below,\nmain() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents\nthe interface to the library function.\n\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\n#include <Xm/PushB.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top)\n{\n        Widget topone = top;\t\t// in real prog, these are member vars\n        XtAppContext theapp = app;\t// of a class\n        int junk = 0;\n        Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,\n                                        NULL);\n\n        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(\"blaaa\", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,\n                        topone,\n                        XmNheight, 50,\n                        XmNwidth, 50,\n                        NULL);\n\n        XtRealizeWidget(topone);\n        for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)\t// real prog returns when \"Exit\" button clicked\n        {\n                XEvent event;\n                XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);\n                XtDispatchEvent(&event);\n        }\n        XtDestroyWidget(box);\n        XtCloseDisplay(dis);\n}\n\n// SetItUp - should be called once only\nvoid SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top)\n{\n        int junk = 0;\n        (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, \"test\", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,\n                NULL, NULL, 0);\n}\n\n// doit - some library function callable from the outside\nvoid doit()\n{\n        static XtAppContext app;\t// use these every time called\n        static Widget top;\n\n        static int setup = 0;\n\n        if (!setup)\n        {\n                SetItUp(&app, &top);\n                setup = 1;\n        }\n        bla(app, top);\n}\n\n// main - program which links to my library\nmain()\n{\n        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)\n        {\n                doit();\n                printf(\"sleeping...\\n\");//widget still on screen at this point\n                sleep(5);\n        }\n}\n\n\nThe problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.\n(It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the \"sleep\" in the main prog,\ndespite the XtDestroyWidget call).\n\nAnyone see something I'm missing?\n\nThanks very much.\n\n(Please respond via email)\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

However, if he opens up a\nsecond xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,\ngiving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.\n\n   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial\none references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier\ncolours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only\nopening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL\nX applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the\ncommand line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different\nfont (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the\ndefault xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose\nall of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the\nfonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font\ndirectories/hash-tables.\n\n   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different\nfont and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\n\nMore info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),\n       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.\n       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc."

Can anybody help me out?\n\nThe problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,\nand these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\n\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".\n\n>In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says \"For information\n>on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...\", this is so you\n>know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to\n>Vol. 4 it says, \"Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is\n>nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For\n>example, the translation:\n>\tShift<Key>q:\tquit()\n>will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as\n>the Shift key (and the q key).\n\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If\nyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\ntranslations.\n\n>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?\n\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it's not possible.  That's according to\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\n\n>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you\n>can't use XtInstallAccelerators().\n\nI can't think of a reason why not.\n\n>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of\n>case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one\n>menu entry.\n\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's\naccelerators on itself and all of its descendants with\nXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).\n\nFor example,\n\n  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade\n\t\t\t\t\t  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  - exitPushbutton\n\n  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O\n  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O\n  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q\n  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q\n\n  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\nYou have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you\ncan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then\nXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.\n\nI tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I\nused TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\ndescribed above should work.\n\n-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)"

When using\non-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep\nit from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they\nwere just about equal.\n\n  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous\nsizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your\napplication dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when\ndebugging SHM apps).\n\n  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.\nUltrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be\nattached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes\nXShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24\nbit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to\nsupport the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using\npixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to\nuse the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one\ncopies the info three times per redraw instead of one).\n\n  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a\nGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick\nwhatever feels fastest.\n\n  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)\n\n  )Rob"

(Speaking of PCs at\nthe moment.)\n\tI don't think it is too much to ask that window\nprogrammers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also\nlook forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and\ncommand line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in\nless time IF you are experienced.\n\tAll of the above equally applies to windowing systems on\nUNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than\nDOS).\n\n-- \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------/\n \\ Seth Buffington \tU.S.S.

Most of the C preprocessors that\n\tI have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the\n\tline.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the\n\tstart of a directive. \n\n\tHowever the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol\n\tas the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines\n\tthat \"This\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my\n\timake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better\n\tfix.\n\n(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular\n\tuse of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp\n\tgives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.\n\nIf you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate\ninformation about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later\nversion of imake that I have not reviewed.)

Can someone help me?\n\nUnfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into\nemacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to\nchange the source code so that all of these special keys generated\ncharacter sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier\nstate as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \"ESC [ 1 B 7\" \nwould indicate that the \"HOME\" key was pressed, with the shift key\ndown.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such\nas \"shift-Return\".\n\nIf anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll\nhave to have the source available and be comfortable munging with\nit a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code\nin the source file \"x11term.c\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is \ninterested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got\nbigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about \nemacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods \nsomewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.\n\nNotes: \n\n * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create\n   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which \n   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.\n\n * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2\n   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are\n   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could \n   easily be adapted for anything else.\n\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+\n| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\///       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\XX/ -------+"

Otherwise you'll have\n    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string\n    instead of using convenient octal sequences.]\n\n    If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show\n    your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll\n    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out\n    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.\n    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence\n    in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...\n\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+\n| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\///       |\n+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\XX/ -------+"

I am \nusing X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be \nworking with Open Look in the future.\n\n     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the \nuser from switching from one window of the application to \nanother window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top \nof Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks \nthe mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the \nwindow hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain \ncircumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to \nbeep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window \nA.\n\n      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that \nthis window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this \ncase Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default \nprocessing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell \nwhen this switching occurs through focus change and mapping \nnotify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the \nswitch.\n\n      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very \nkludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch \nin those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force \nthe formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call \nand beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary \nfunctionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places \ntwice.\n\n      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* \nwindow manager) when I don't want the window order switch to \nactually take place?

        "content": "Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\n\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will\nneed Motif 1.1 or better.\n\nThe following files are available for anonymous ftp from \nftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking\n\ntcpview-1.0.tar.Z\ttcpview and tcpdump source code\ntcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z\tSun4 binaries\ntcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z\tDEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries\n\nWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:\n- easier interface\n- enhanced protocol decoding\n- hex display of frame\n- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt\n- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name\n- ethernet address host table\n- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames\n- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional\n\tprocessing.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1\n\nNew features:\n\nNow reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.

        "subject": "How to see characterset from wchar_t",
        "content": "We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System.\nThe toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n\nfacility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's \nX11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit\nuses Xsi.\n\nOur toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.\nIn order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\nand application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\n\nWe need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters\nfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.\n\nWe could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used\nXsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the\nsource code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.\n\n\n//I18N.h\n// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-\n// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $\n\n#ifndef _I18N_H\n#define _I18N_H\n\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n\nextern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,\t/* IN */\n\t\t\t\t int wc_len,\t\t/* IN */\n\t\t\t\t char *buf,\t\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t\t int *buflen,\t\t/* IN/OUT */\n\t\t\t\t int *scanned_len,\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t\t char **charset);\t/* OUT */\nextern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);\nextern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);\n\n#endif /* _I18N_H */\n\n//I18N.cc\n/* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */\n\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <X11/Xlibint.h>\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\n#include \"I18N.h\"\n\nextern \"C\" {\n#include <X11/wchar.h>\n#define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\n#define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs\n#define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid\n#include \"Xlocaleint.h\"\n#undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\n#undef _Xmbfscs\n#undef _Xmbctidtocsid\n    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,\n\t\t\t\t\t char*, int*, int*, int*);\n    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);\n    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);\n};\n\nint decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */\n\t\t\t  int wc_len,\t\t/* IN */\n\t\t\t  char *buf,\t\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t  int *buf_len,\t\t/* IN/OUT */\n\t\t\t  int *scanned_len,\t/* OUT */\n\t\t\t  char **charset)\t/* OUT */\n{\n    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();\n    int ctid;\n    int status;\n    Charset *xcharset;\n    \n    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,\n\t\t\t\t       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);\n    if (status == Success) {\n\txcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));\n\t*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;\n    }\n    else\n\t*charset = NULL;\n    return status;\n}\n----------------\n\nAn included file above, \"Xlocaleint.h\", is also Xsi internal and we copied\nthe file to the toolkit directory and compiled.\n\nA serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on\nour HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.\n\nWhen we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,\nlink errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:\n    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)\n    _Xmbfscs (code)\n    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)\n    _XFallBackConvert (code)\n\nWe had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until\nHP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that\nbecause HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to \nknow how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used \nits internal functions. \n\nThe HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.\nWe observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are\nnot sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and\ntherefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not\nseem to lead us a solution.\n\nMy question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like\n'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check\ncharacter set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?\nIf it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we\nwant to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.\n\nIn order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery\nto judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for\nthe string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source \nfiles. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. \nAny help or comments would be highly appreciated.\n\nI also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area\neven if it is not HP's implementation.\n\nThank you.\n\n--\n\t\t\t\tTakeshi Inoue\n\t\t\t\tinoue@crd.yokogawa.co.jp\n\t\t\t\tYokogawa Electric Corporation\n\t\t\t\tOpen Systems Laboratory\t0422(52)5557"

It is the \"X Window System\", or \"X11\", or \"X\" or any of\na number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.

This probably tells you something\nabout how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME\nof the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have \nto say?\n\nWith regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can\nbuy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both \nGraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11\nover serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)  \n\nNCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is\nNCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such \nsoftware packages available.\n\nX11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running\nX11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and \nis based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. \n\nIt seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there\nwill be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various \nsorts of hardware.\n\nFollowups directed to comp.windows.x\n--\n Matt Landau\t\t\tWaiting for a flash of enlightenment\n matt@centerline.com\t\t\t  in all this blood and thunder"

If you've got\n$20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good\nchoice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar\narchitecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact\ninformation, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't\nbe too hard to find.\n\nIf you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook\n(hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language\nwhich is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting,\nbut not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.\n\nYou might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing\ndirect importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release\navailable for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in\nfunctionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs\n$495.

Andrew's major feature is its\narchitecture for recursive embedding of objects: equation in table in\nfigure in text, for example.  This architecture extends to areas not\nusually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, and\nprinting.\n\nAndrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications: \nword processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the latter\ntwo are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the XR6 tape\nin December.)\n\nFred Hansen\nDirector, Andrew Consortium"

After X is fully\nstarted we run an xterm as the \"console\" - the problem is that any messages\nthat arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  \"Refresh window\" fails\nto remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of\nthe screen obscuring anything else below them.\n\nAt boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.\nWe're running X in color, and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are\non the B/W framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted.\n\nMy question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid\nof these messages?\n\nPlease reply by e-mail to hughm@inmos.co.uk.\n\nHugh McIntyre.\nINMOS Ltd., Bristol, UK.\n\n(BTW: SunOS 4.0.3, X11R5, mwm).\n\nPS: I know I can redirect output of the relevant commands to /dev/null - I'm\n    looking for a more general solution)."

The fact \nthat many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  \n\nAs for the trade publications that promulgate things like \"X Window\" or\n\"X.windows\" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, \nconsider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by \n*journalists*.

There have, however, been some excellent\nUIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will\nconsider questions such as\n\tWhat is needed for application construction by non-programmers?\n\tCan we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?\n\tIs it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to\ncreate new widgets?\n\tShould widgets and applications be able to print themselves?\n\nYour participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate\non the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including\n\n\tapplications\n\texperience with users\n\tnew objects\n\treviews of and proposals for revision of \n\t\tinternal Andrew protocols\n\nWe expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would\nlike to do a demonstration.  \n\nPaper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993.\nAcceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.\n\nSend papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.\n\nFred Hansen\nDirector, Andrew Consortium"

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have\nbeen changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.\n\nThis is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will\nincorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support\nX11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.\n\nNote to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this\ndistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.\n\nHere is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,\nhas developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++\nclasses. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through\nmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library\nwas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.\nHowever, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only\nworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no\nlonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.\n\nI, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell \nbindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and\nenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the\ngeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).\n\nNEW RELEASE\n\nI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++\nbindings. \n\nThis release offers:\n\n- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support\n- Support for Xbae widgetset \n- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate\n  progress in an application.\n- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake\n\t\t     and its config files on your site. I have tried to\n\t\t     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable\n\t\t     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely\n\t\t     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you\n\t\t     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma\n\t\t     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude\n\t\t     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.\n- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)\n- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted\n  on Usenet.\n\nWHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS\n\nFtp:\n\nAnonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.\n\nNote:\n\nPlease be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large\nfiles during working hours.\n\nAlso note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this\nis an old version of the bindings.\n\nE-mail:\n\nThose who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by\ne-mail.\n\nREQUEST\n\nThose who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please\ncontact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of\nbugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). \n\nMORE INFORMATION \n\nContact me at \"rvloon@cv.ruu.nl\".\nIf you are desperate, then you can call me at\n+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands\ncall 030-506711).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-- \nRonald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference \n(rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice.\n3DCV Group, Utrecht |   \nThe Netherlands     | In practice however, there is."

This doesn't mean that every window manager\nauthor in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and\nimplemented this at top priority.\n\nThe ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at\nstartup.

Since standard colormaps\ntypically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid\ndisplacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one\nCLUT.\n\nI don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible\ncolormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,\ncolormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the\nsame standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a\nfull color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's\ncalled under X11R5).\n\nIf you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default\ncolormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into\nthat colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one\nhw CLUT framebuffer.\n\nNow if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your\nclient, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window\nmanagers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?\n-- \n\n   -paul\tpmartz@dsd.es.com\n\t\tEvans & Sutherland"

I\ndecided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling\nXDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are\nwaiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).\nI was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring\nthe standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis\nit was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString\nwas doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor\nwas called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating\nwas not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that\nsays you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.\nWe are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4.\n\n\n\n-- \nRegards, Martin\n\n   /\\/\\     :  Martin Visser - Electrical / Software Engineer \n  / / /\\    :  Engineering Technology Department\n / / /  \\   :  BHP Steel - Slab and Plate Products Division\n/ / / /\\ \\  :  P.O.

        "content": "Hello X'ers\n\nI have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes. The\nfollowing code illustrates the problem:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n#include <X11/Xutil.h>\n\nmain()\n{\n        Display *display;\n        Window win;\n        XVisualInfo vinfo;\n        Colormap colormap;\n        XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\n        XEvent event;\n        Status status;\n\n        display=XOpenDisplay(NULL);\n        status=XMatchVisualInfo(display,DefaultScreen(display),24,TrueColor,\n                &vinfo);\n        if (!status){\n                fprintf(stderr,\"Visual not found\\n\");\n                exit(1);\n        }\n        colormap=XCreateColormap(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),\n                vinfo.visual,AllocNone);\n\n        attributes.colormap=colormap;\n\n        win=XCreateWindow(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),0,0,100,100,\n                0,24,InputOutput,vinfo.visual,CWColormap,&attributes);\n        XMapWindow(display,win);\n        for (;;){\n                XNextEvent(display,&event);\n        }\n}\n\nI tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server, and with an HP\n9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change),\nboth running X11R4. On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on\nHP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the\ncombinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request.\n\nAs far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give\na BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the\nvisual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message. What\nam I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the\nsame error.\n\n                                   Karsten\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInterNet:       krs@kampsax.dk                             Karsten Spang\nPhone:          +45 36 77 22 23                            Kampsax Data\nFax:            +45 36 77 03 01                            P.O.

        "content": "The Andrew Consortium\n          of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon \n                         is pleased to announce\n\n                          AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2\n                                 4/26/93\n\nThe Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was\ndeveloped for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other\nplatforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to\nthe sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its\napplication can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the\ninternet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory\n./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5\" diskette can be\nordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address\nbelow. \n\nThe base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the\nsame host.\n\nNote that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows\nAUIS to compile under AIX3.2.\n\n-----------\n\nThe Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment\non top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media\napplications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the\ncapability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that\nnot only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but\nalso  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,\nequations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can\nthemselves contain other objects, including text.\n\nAUIS has three components:\n\n    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set\n    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help\n    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell\n    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various\n    available types of objects. \n\n    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented\n    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein\n    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,\n    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as\n    easily as those that come with the system. \n\n    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface\n    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail\n    management strategies and implements many advanced  features\n    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of\n    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails\n    of related messages, and subscription management. It also\n    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and\n    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function\n    workstations. \n\nThe current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for\nthe new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards\nfor multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of\nthe Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new\neditors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.\n\n\nRemote Andrew Demo Service\n\nYou can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew\nDemo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11\nwindow system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate\nthrough the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System\nto browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and\nnewsgroups.\n\nTo get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the\nfollowing command on your machine:\n\n\tfinger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu\n\nThe service will give you further instructions.   \n\n\nMore information about Andrew is available from:\n\n    Information Requests\n    Andrew Consortium\n    Carnegie Mellon University\n    Smith Hall 106\n    5000 Forbes Avenue\n    Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n    USA\n    phone: +1-412-268-6710\n    fax: +1-412-682-6938\n    info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu\n\nContact info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu for additional information."

When they are set to japanese,\n  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything\n  works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.\n  (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual\n   application, just in my sample code to make things easier)\n\t\n- I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.

I have remembered to do   \n  XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources\n  are set to japanese fonts.\n\n- Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially\n  created with UIL. \n\n\nThe problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting\nXmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable\nalternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)\n\nI have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone\nwants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not\nproperly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the\nsource to look at it is just a guess.\n\nPlease let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,\nor if you want the sample program.\n\nTHANKS!!!!!!!!\n\n- Susan \n\n  swalker@bbn.com\n  617-873-8190"

Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window\nis popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. \nAt this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.\n\nIf a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it\nneeds to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it\nthere.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow\nrequest that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The\nIntrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after\nwmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because\nthe request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the\nsame.)\n\nThe solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information\nin ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5\npublic fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in\ngorier details.\n\ns'marks\n\n-- \nStuart W.

        "content": "Answers please by e-mail, since not all groups in the header are carried here.\n\nHi!\n\nPersonally, I like NeXTSTEP very much. Even more when I realise how much a  \nburden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better  \nthan I like C++.\n\nBut, sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be  \nMS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments  \nthat come close to NeXTSTEP, the appkit etc. Also, environs that support rapid  \nprototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want  \nto do real work.\n\nMaybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews  \n(what it is exactly, I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I  \nstarted with NeXTSTEP.)\n\nThanks,\n\n-- \nGerben Wierda    [NeRD:7539]        Tel.

It trys to be intelligent about\nwhat it's doing so that you should be able to type \"rx host.domain.etc\",\nand get a xterm running on \"host.domain.etc\", with all the difficult\nstuff taken care of.\n\nIn theory, this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to do\nwhen you wanted to run a remote command in the background - it\ndoesn't even need to be an X program.  Try a \"rx big-machine make\"\nfor instance, for a backgrounded make on the remote \"big-machine\".\n\nFor more details and a full list of features read the README file,\nabout 20 lines below...

To allow the execution\nXof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to\nXthe remote session.  If you omit\nX.IR command ,\nXthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The\nX.B rxterm\nXvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes\nX.I args\nXto the remote xterm as arguments.\nX.PP\nXShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local\nXmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote\nXmachine.\nX.PP\nXIf the name of the file from which\nX.B rx\nXis executed is anything other than ``rx,''\nX.B rx\nXtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command\nXto run on the remote host, using any\nX.I command\nXparameters as arguments for the remote command.\nX.PP\nXIf\nX.B rx\nXthinks you are using\nX.B xauth\nXbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or\nXto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization\nXkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use\nX.B xhost(1)\nXto grant access to the remote host.\nX.SH OPTIONS\nX.TP\nX.BI \\-l \" username\"\nXUse\nX.I username\nXas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence\nXof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username.\nX\nX.SH ENVIRONMENT\nXIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR,\nXXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,\nXand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the\nXremote username is different, or the remote host is off-site, in which\nXcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the\nXvariable RXENV.\nX.PP\nXThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified\nXa hostname as is needed.\nX.SH DIAGNOSTICS\nX.TP\nX.IB command \": don't recognise my name.\"\nX.B rx\nXcannot decode the name it has been called under.  In this case\nXit prints a warning message, and continues, as normal.\nX.TP\nX.B \"rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...]\"\nXThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it.\nX.SH AUTHOR\nXDuncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk>, July 1992\nX.br\nXOriginally based on a program with the same name from the\nX.B gwm\nXdistribution.

Especially when \nXit's only one of them.\nX.PP\nXSometimes quoting can get messed up.\nX.PP\nXIt's too easy to fool the smarts in\nX.B rx\nXto make it believe something that is not true, and fail because of it.\nX.PP\nXWhen\nX.B rx\nXuses\nX.B xhost\nXto grant access, the\nX.B xhost\nXcommand may fail silently.\nX.PP\nXIf\nX.B rx\nXtries to send to large a command to the remote machine, it will\nXlikely fail with a parse error from csh.

If you really want Tom to reply\nyou should send mail to support@qdeck.com.\n\nA 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps\nethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on \nwhat you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances\nof some really nasty program like \"Smoking Clover\" would make the link \nuseless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly\nupdating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real\nworld, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.\n\nGoing by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have\nto share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.\n\n>>Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\n>>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\n>>thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\n>>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\n>\n>Hmmm.

The usage patterns are not very\ngood predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth\nlinks that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they\noften use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database \nremotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always\nat this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview\nX and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having\na long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about\nhow you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.\n\nRunning Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.\nLet's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy\nand efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a\nlittle more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen\nthat was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server\nthat it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough\nmemory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network\ntraffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a \nsolid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite\neasily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send\nit back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw\nthat small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be \nrepainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits\nthat has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.\nIn reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts \nthat will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.\n\n>\n>\n>>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\n>>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\n>>doing network things also...)\n>>-- \n>\n>What do you mean by network things?

I am wondering how \n>good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these \n>images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.\n\nX was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's \npretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost\nas good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.\nWe intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver\nkeyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in\nno way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a \nlot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but\nwe are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications\ntell us.\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   |\n|         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\\  |\n|  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\\  |\n|   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\\  |\n|          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\\  |\n|    Pricing/Ordering info :  info@qdeck.com      _____///////////______\\  |\n|     Technical Questions  : support@qdeck.com    __/////////////_______\\  |\n|         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+"

That way the user's usual environment gets set\nup as normal and inherited by everything.

The color information\nis associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_\na parameter to the drawing routines.\n\nSo, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of\nwidth 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do\n\nXDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2);\nXDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4);\n\nfor this effect.\n\nThis is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much\nmore efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters\nlike line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every\ndrawing call, so why do it for color ?

        "content": "Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists\n              ---------------------------------------------\n   \n   Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful\n   information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET\n   newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly,\n   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum\n   for SCO products in general.\n   \n   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO\n   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been\n   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt\n   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*\n   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.\n\n   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in\n   accordance with accepted procedure within \"biz\".  Given the content,\n   this change relocated the \"opendesktop\" newsgroup to a more proper place\n   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new \"announce\"\n   and \"general\" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former \"sco-list@uunet.uu.net\"\n   became \"scogen\" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.\n\n   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992\n   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific\n   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are\n   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy\n   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.\n   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to\n   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.\n\n   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion\n   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.\n   \n   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,\n   you are now able to subscribe to the following:\n   \n        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription\n        ---------                    -------------------------\n        biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca\n        biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca\n        biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca\n\tbiz.sco.sources\t\t\t<none>\n\tbiz.sco.binaries\t\t<none>\n\tbiz.sco.magazine\t     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca\n\n   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET\n   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news\n   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and\n   I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in\n   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.\n   If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive\n   biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.\n   \n   The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion\n   mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a\n   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.\n   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate\n   \"mailing list subscription\" address above, including in the message body:\n\n\tAdd: subscriber_address\t\t-eg-\n\tAdd: your_logname@site.do.main  -or-\n\tAdd: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname\n\n   Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know\n   major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled\n   the same way, simply substitute \"Delete:\" for \"Add:\", ensuring that\n   you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list\n   subscribers receive \"how to post to the mlist\" article submission\n   information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive\n   an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test\n   message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely\n   that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do\n   the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your\n   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list\n   subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have\n   with the site(s) feeding you.\n   \n   Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged\n   drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we\n   are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a\n   handful of subscribers this way each month.

Now, this is not so simple because some window managers\nslap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,\nso be sure to take that into account for further calculations.\n\nCalculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using\nXGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION.\nRemember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the\nwindows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAll of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the\nwindow-manager is using.\n\nNow, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate \nwhere you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on\nthe OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly).\n\nDISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code.

(To vastly\nover-simplify what goes on, we just take the windows graphics API calls,\nand translate them directly to X-protocol; unfortunately, windows was\nnot really written to be network-aware, so sometimes we see a speed\npenalty when an app does something stupid, like sending a big white bitmap\nto erase something rather than just drawing a white box; fortunately,\nthat sort of thing is rare...)\n\n>3) If I want to run MS Word, for example, remotely, do I have to\n>run a separate copy of MS Windows remotely, and then start MS\n>Word from that, or can MS Word be started remotely on its own?\n\nYou need to run MS windows, which Word then runs inside. You could run\nmultiple windows programs within the one WinX window, and windows has\nways to automagically start winapps when you start windows, so in practice\nit's not really a major problem.

I believe\nthat X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics\nand displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my\npath, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but\nnot for the family I am using (Helvetica).\n\nI think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the\nresolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you\nexplicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the\nscaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command\n\nxfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).\n\nThe command  \n\nxfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).\nDespite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can\ngenerate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a\nresolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.\n\nIs this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can\ndo to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about\nmy resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).\nThis would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to\nlook at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: \"Yup, thats\nan inch\".

It's compatible with the\n    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,\n    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.\n    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.\n    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the\n    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.\n    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as\n    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.\n    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,\n    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.\n    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:\n\tSunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0\n\tSolaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0\n\tSolaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1\n\n    See Also:\n\tMixing X11 and OpenWindows\n\tWhere can I get it?\n\n@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?\n    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs\n    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography\n    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:\n\n    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;\n    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were\n    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,\n    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the\n    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in\n    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in\n    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a\n    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).\n    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably\n    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or\n    anything else that uses subclasses.\n    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]\n\n    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in\n    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help\n    migrate source code from SunView to XView.\t XView is often said to be\n    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.\n    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is\n    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).\n    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.\n    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the\n    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be\n    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.\n    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much\n    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.\n\n    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based\n    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the\n    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of\n    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.\n\n    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some\n    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to\n    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time\n    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.\n    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the\n    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.\n    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.\n\n    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++\n    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from\n    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify\n    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be\n    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the\n    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.\n    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of\n    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in\n    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).\n\n@ Where does Motif fit in?\n    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that\n    is being developed by OSF.\tIt has a `look and feel' reminiscent of\n    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-\n    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold\n    reasonably cheaply by OSF.\tAlthough Motif is currently available on\n    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly\n    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a\n    large installed base.\n    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif\n    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in\n    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.\n\n@ What is MoOLIT?\n    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between\n    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V\n    Release 4.2.\n    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677\n\n@ What about that Display PostScript thing?\n    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X\n    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed\n    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a\n    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously\n    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it\n    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less\n    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.\n    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;\n    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.\n    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS\n    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to\n    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.\n    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts\n    available, however)\n\nSubject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm\n\n@ What are olwm and olvwm?\n    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window\n    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows\n    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.\n\n    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.\n    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and\n    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.\n\n    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the\n    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the\n    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.\t You can\n    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This\n    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around\n    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm\n    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.\n    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib\n    directory; there are three patches).\n\n@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?\n    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use\n    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the\n    footers some windows use to display certain messages.\n\n    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus\n    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run\n    under olwm.\n    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:\n\tLeftTitleButton \"target\" = f.delete\n    where \"target\" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.\n    Alternatively, try\n\t# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm\n\tLeftTitleButton \":menu\" = f.menu \"OL.menu\"\n\n\tmenu \"OL.menu\" {\n\t    \"Quit\"         f.delete\n\t}\n\n    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title\n    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).\n\n    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).\n\nSubject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays\n\n@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?\n    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.\n    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.\n    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS\n    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes\n    pageview in particular.\n\n    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-\n    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)\n    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about\n    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.\n    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you\n    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's\n    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.\n\n\nSubject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows\n     \n@ What configuration files do I need to know about?\n\n    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc\n\n    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in\n    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to\n    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files\n    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.\n\n    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,\n    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.\n\n    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys\n\n    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,\n    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.\n    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files\n    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need\n    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an\n    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,\n    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's \"contool\" program so that\n    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.\n    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.\n\n    .Xdefaults\n\n    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,\n    it is a good idea to include at least:\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:\ttrue\n\t*Input: TRUE\n    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they\n    forget to ask for it.\n\n    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default\n    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.\n    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.\n\n    .startup.ps\n\n    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)\n    on startup.\t This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the\n    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change\n    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a\n    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up\n    at all or will get broken in strange ways.\tThe NeWS manual gives code\n    that is both incorrect and insufficient.\n    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.\n\n    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see\n    the man page for xset (\"man xset\", and \"xset -help\") for more information.\n\n    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of\n    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of\n    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for\n    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime\n    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to\n    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your\n    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...\n\n\t% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual\n\t% /IncludeDemos? false def\n\n\tUserProfile begin\n\t    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def\n\t    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def\n\t    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...\n\tend\n\n    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:\n\n\t/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\t/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\t/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\n\tClassRepeatKeys pop\t% force repeat.ps to autoload\n\n\tendpackage endpackage endpackage\n\n    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the\n    OpenWindows server like this:\n\t$ psh -i .startup.ps\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n\t$ psh -i\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n\t/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send\n\t%%% now press control-D\n\n    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make\n    the root window be \"retained\", so that a PostScript drawing on the\n    background won't be erased when you move windows:\n\tframbuffer /Retained true put\n    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used\n    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.\n    \n    See also:\n\tTrouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type\n\tTrouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults?\n\tEnvironment Variables\n\n@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?\n    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one\n    or two occasional surprises.  See also \"man 7 xview\" for a list of\n    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.\n\n    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings\n    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should\n    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this\n    in your .xinitrc:\n\n    if eval `svenv -env`\n    then\n\txmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3\"\n\tinput_from_defaults\n    else\n\txmodmap -e \"pointer = 3 2 1\"\n    fi\n\n\n@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?\n\n    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but\n    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.\n    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as\n    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system\n    run screenblank automatically.\n\nSubject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste\n\n@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?\n\n    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):\n    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button\n      in xterm\n    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly\n      XView manual gets this wrong)\n    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)\n\n    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste\n\n   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:\n    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY\n    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).\n    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.\n\n@ COPY/PASTE is boring.\t What short-cuts are available?\n\n    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:\n    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button\n    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined\n      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)\n    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.\n    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection\n    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-\n      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button\n    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse\n      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the\n      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).\n    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want\n      to drop the text\n    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show\n      that it's OK to drop things here\n    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.\tThis works in text fields of\n      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection\n    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that\n      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.\n\n@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?\n\n    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.\n    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when\n    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the\n    right of the insert point.\n\n\tMeta-i - include file\t    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)\n\n\tCtrl-a - start of line\t    Ctrl-< - back word\n\tCtrl-e - end of line\t    Ctrl-> - forward word\n\tCtrl-w - delete word\t    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line\n\tCtrl-Return - move to end/START of document\n\n    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default\n    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.\n\n@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?\t Where is it documented?\n\n    See the manual page for shelltool.\n\nSubject: Applications: Finding Out...\n    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,\n    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_\n    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.\n\n    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular\n    OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor\n    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full\n    product documentation.\n\n    SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which\n    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as\n    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.\n\n    There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists\n    a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a\n    copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a\n    faster reply.\n\nSubject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc.\n\n@ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?\n    Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.\n    If \"man cm_delete\" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under\n    Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.\n\n@ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?\n    The best way is:\n    $ cd\n    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .\n    $ chmod +w .textswrc\n    edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)\n    add the follwing:\n\tKEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER\n\tcat ~/.signature\n    (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)\n\n    Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.\n\n\n\nSubject: Fonts\n\n@ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts?\n    Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).\n    Or, Not Yet, in other words.\n\n    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.\n    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and\n    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is\n    interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the\n    Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on\n    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.\n\n    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably\n    other major foundries.\n\n    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.\n\n@ Improving font rendering time\n    Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as\n    fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes\n    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache\n    parameters.\t If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the\n    font cache size.\n\t$ psh -i\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you\n\tcurrentfontmem =\t% type this line ...\n\t300\t% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes\n\t1024 setfontmem\n\t% Just to check:\n\tcurrentfontmem =\n\t1024\n    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.

Your licence forbids you from using the\n    fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't\n    use them for printing.

If you're\n    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of\n    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.\n\n@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?\n    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.\n    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output\n    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.\n    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.

These notes apply to\n    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with\n    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.\n\n    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.\tYou can intermix OpenWindows\n    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.\n    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.\n\n    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions\n    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a\n    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory\n    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have\n    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in\n    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead\n    of OpenWindows ones!\n\n    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11\n    library directory.\tThis doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with\n    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't\n    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although\n    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.\n\n    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't\n    /usr/openwin.\n\n    See Also:\n\tEnvironment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).\n\n@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found\n    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.

Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches\n    and install the patch.\n\n@ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me?\n    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.\tIt won't run under\n    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw\n    the PostScript text and pictures.\n    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0\n    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.\n    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace\n    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to\n    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)\n    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.\n    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with\n    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).\n\n@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?\n    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from\n    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z\n\n@ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?\n    It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties\n    Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.\n\n@ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool\n    Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.

Ftp, implementations, etc...\n\n    XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and\n    elsewhere.\n\n    MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form.\n\n    OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun, or you can get the source from\n    Interactive Systems Inc.  It is also included in some vendors' System V\n    Release 4 implementations, although that's not always the latest version.\n    The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures\n    is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0.\n    Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as\n    the windowing system for Solaris.\n\n    There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either\n    available now or in progress.  Unfortunately, none of them seem to\n    be available from anywhere.

These\n  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the\n  performance of your workstation.\n\n  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more\n  hardware is always even a necessity.\n\n  This \"FAQ\" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different\n  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X\n  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.\n\n  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must\n  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal\n  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many\n  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.\n\n  This document is specifically concerned with X.

IMHO, it contains a\n    well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm\n    unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.]\n\n-----------------\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n  0. Introduction & Administrivia\n  1. What about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n  2.

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n\t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n\t\t\t\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\n\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

I suspect that\n  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.\n  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.\n\n  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines\n  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),\n\t\t   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]\n\n1) Xvt\n   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :\n   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z\n\n   \"...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get\n   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as\n   xterm is rather a hog! \"\n\n   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current\n   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any\n   yet.\n\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\n   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.\n\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\n   brought into memory.\n\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\n   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.\n   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.\n   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,\n   relative speed of each\n\n2) mterm\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in\n     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.\n\n   \"I also have my own terminal emulator.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n\t\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n\t\t\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\n\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\n  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different\n  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  \n\n  e.g. (for twm) :\n      menu \"mouse settings\" {\n        \"Mouse Settings:\"\t\t\tf.title\n\t\"  Very Fast\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 7 10 &\"\n\t\"  Normal (Fast)\"\t\t\t! \"xset m 3 10 &\"\n\t\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\"\t! \"xset m default &\"\n\t\"  Glacial\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 0 10 &\"\n      }\n\nProgramming Thoughts\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of\n    things you can do.  Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\n    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the\n    same operation between client and server.\n\n  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received\n  the following confirmation...\n\n  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):\n    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big\n    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage\n    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This\n    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was\n    essential when I only had 8 MB.\n\n  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :\n    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as\n    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\n\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

        "content": "Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can\nhelp me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color,\nsay red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want\nto be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it\nis larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000.\n\nMy problem is this: when I resize the window, only the \"original\" part of the\nwindow that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else\nis a grey..the oval \"tries\" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that\nit WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in\nthe region that was the original size of the window when created.\n\nFor example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I\nresize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is\nis from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval\nonly shows up in that 200x200 area.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a \nre-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?\n\nSecond question:\nCould someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are???\n\nThanks,\nChris"

        "content": "Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and\nit seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and\ncan point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is:\nGiven a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the\ndata  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow\nlink), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the\npicture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture\nmight first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of\npixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square\nwould be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be\npainted.\n\nSince  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side\nof a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted\nas  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to\nbe a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a\nsmall  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the\nmagnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X\nserver  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to\nask that a \"filter\" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the\nonly  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process\n(\"Permission denied\" ;-), and have it open a local window?\n\nIt seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up\nsuch  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each\none by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.\nBut  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice\nto hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  I\nobviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool\navailable that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.\n\nOh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build\ndemos  that  can  show such things as \"If this were run across, say, a\n4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear.\"  Then  the\ncustomer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.\n\n-- \nIf the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would  now\ncost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times would\nexplode, killing all its passengers."

The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.\n  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or\n    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our\n    European friends.\n  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.\n  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring\n    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,\n    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).\n  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale \n    or color on a Color monitor.)\n  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that\n    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)\n  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution\n    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).\n\n    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people\n    are encouraged to use in other programs.\n\n    Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:\n        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n        appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n\n\nFrom the ghostscript README:\n\n*****************************************************\n* This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. *\n*****************************************************\n\n********\n******** An overview of Ghostscript ********\n********\n\nGhostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:\n\n        - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very\nclosely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and\n\n        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that\nimplement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive\noperations in the Ghostscript language.\n\nThe Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely\nin C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.\nCurrently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform\nfamilies:\n\n        - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible\n          graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;\n\n        - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,\n          release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,\n          Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;\n          H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX\n          running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;\n          Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;\n\n        - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;\n\n        - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler\n          version 3.1 or later is required).\n\n\n(Get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview.)\n\n-- \nTim Williams                                   COM: (703) 704-1685\nNight Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate  DSN: 654-1685\nAMSEL-RD-NV-VISPD (Williams)                   FAX: (703) 704-1705\nFt.

It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming\ninterface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.\nXm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the\nAthena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both\nenvironments without changes, although many nice features are only\navailable when using Motif.\nIn some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing\na ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it -\ndata of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated\nin rare cases.\n\nXm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to\nencapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many\nideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version,\nwhich provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications\n(in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and\na simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).\n\nTop level objects in Xm++:\n* 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout\n  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw\n* 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface\n  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this\n  distribution)\n\nControls (children of top level objects):\n'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton',\n'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'\n\nThe staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap\nformat) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.\n\nEvent handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects\nXt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.\n\n\nCommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides\ncomponents for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very\nsimplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system\n(research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a\nsoftware achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications\nwith multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).\nIf you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS\nPublications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be\nour paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of\nthe art' from 1991).\nCommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was\nused to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing\nprimitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to\nsupport bitmaps and some controls also.\nKnown problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always\nredraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an\nobject), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.\n\n\nAbout this first release:\n\nXm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here\nfor smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think\nI can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications\nfor any non-critical purposes.\nCommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will\nbe continued this year because we plan to use it for another research\nproject here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems\nto be stable and can be used for experimental applications.\n\nPlatforms: this release was compiled and tested on:\n  HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07\n  SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1\n  PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6\n\nCaution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T\nstandard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or\nabove (the next release will be tested with both compilers).\n\nWhere to get it:\n================\n\nI have uploaded it on: export.lcs.mit.edu as: /contrib/Xm++.0.5.tar.Z\n\n(send a mail, if you cannot find it there, e-mail addr. below)\n\nWhere to find more information:\n===============================\n\nthe .../doc directory contains\n   INSTALL - how to build the libraries and examples\n   README.GNU - problems and limitations when using gnu g++ (read!!)\n   usersGuide.txt - a tutorial how to use Xm++\n   reference.txt - a first try of a Xm++ class reference manual\n\nthe README files in the .../samples gives a brief description of\neach of the seven samples.\n\n\nXm++/CommonInteract is free software for any non-profit purposes,\nsee the file .../lib/COPYRIGHT for details.\n\nSend any comments, bug reports and donations :-) to the Author:\n\n    Bernhard Strassl\n    Vienna User Interface Group\n\tInstitute for Applied Computer Science and Information Systems\n    University of Vienna\n    Lenaugasse 2/8, A-1080 Wien, Austria\n\ne-mail: xmplus@ani.univie.ac.at"

You even get blinking text - ok, enough\nadvertising.\n\nI haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories\nI have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do\nwhat we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since\nxterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to\nX10).\n\nThe actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you\nprovide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the\ncursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.\nSince it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you \ndo anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just\nhave to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after\nit's mapped.\n\nAs for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export\nis still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new\nrelease for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.\nBut since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say\nwhoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.\n\nAs is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else \nthan a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line\nof code). I'll put this on export today.\n\nMichael\n--\nMichael Elbel, Digital-PCS GmbH, Muenchen, Germany - me@dude.pcs.com\nIntelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe - Mia\nFermentation fault (coors dumped)"

My vampire\n  program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote\n  command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth)\n\n     Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do\n  this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow\n  you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes\n  the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required.\n\n     The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also\n  pass environment variables, as well as the current directory.  You will\n  however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for\n  passing.

It is then a matter of\n  an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information\n  from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly.\n    A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does\n  this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the\n  actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your\n  authorization.\n    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the\n  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or\n  stty'ing your terminal.\n\n  ---8<---\n  script for launching rlogin:\n    #!/bin/sh\n    # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:\n    if [ -n \"$DISPLAY\" ]; then\n      case \"$DISPLAY\" in\n        :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;\n      esac\n      TERM=\"$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`\"\n      export TERM\n    fi\n    rlogin $*\n  ---8<---\n  add to your .cshrc or .login\n    if ( $?TERM ) then\n      if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then\n        echo \"$TERM\" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge -\n        setenv DISPLAY `echo \"$TERM\" | cut '-d&' -f2`\n        setenv TERM    `echo \"$TERM\" | cut '-d&' -f1`\n      endif\n    endif\n  ---8<---\n  xterm command to use\n    xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname\n  ---8<---\n\n3/ NFS.\n     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.\n   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization\n   is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your\n   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means.

Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each\n  individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known\n  by others, nor should it be easy to determine.\n    A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give\n  the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone\n  who is asking.\n    This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill\n  I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave\n  up this method.

Jordan implemented the system\ndependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,\ncall it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include\nfile for your specific machine or operating system using the basic\nimplementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a \nOS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to\nreally implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically\nfor just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file\ntty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all\nit still is probably better to implement a include file for each and\nevery operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type\nof mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm\nsources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a \ncouple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the \n\"drivers\" actually included from the toplevel include file will be \ncompiled into emu.\n\nIt shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully\nrelies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux\nsystem available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest\nyou read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or\nquestions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately\nwe have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we \njust don't have access to that many different systems.\n\nMichael\n\n\n--\nMichael Elbel, Digital-PCS GmbH, Muenchen, Germany - me@dude.pcs.com\nIntelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe - Mia\nFermentation fault (coors dumped)"

Nineteen full\nand half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days\nprovide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor\nexhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what\nfolks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.\n\nSpeakers at Xhibition 93 include: \n\n  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, \n  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, \n  Doug Young, and many others.\n\nXhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional\nconferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of\ninterest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object\nManagement Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server\ntechnologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;\nand (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.\n\nWith the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing\napplications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a\nplayer as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many\ndesktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be\nevaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and\nsuppliers.\n\nThe mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information\nto the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference\nat Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide\nthe *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX\ndevelopers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has\nwhat you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is\nthe place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you\nwhat you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development\nKits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an\nXhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience\nis growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a\nconfusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of\nthe other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion.\n\n\n-Aub Harden\n Technical Program Manager\n harden@ics.com\n\n\n        X H I B I T I O N   The Conference and Trade\n         ******    *****    Show for Corporate\n        *      *       *    Software Development\n         ******     ***  \n             *         *    201 Broadway\n          ***     *****     Cambridge, MA  02139\n\n              Windows on Distributed Computing\n\n                 June 7 - 11,   San Jose, CA\n\n           xhibit@ics.com  uunet!ics.com!xhibit\n        Voice: (617) 621-0060  Fax: (617) 621-9555\n\n      Presented by Integrated Computer Solutions, Inc."

Actual measurements\n(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to\n20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is\nfiltered by the window manager as well as the applications and how\nmany processes are needed for each character.)\n\nWhile a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking\nprocess, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like\n10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase\nin overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working\nset.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many\nas 50.\n\nIf you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!\n\n\nNick Maclaren\nUniversity of Cambridge Computer Laboratory,\nNew Museums Site, Pembroke Street,\nCambridge CB2 3QG, England.\nEmail:  nmm1@cus.cam.ac.uk\nTel.:   +44 223 334761\nFax:    +44 223 334679"

        "content": "Bristol Technology announces the availability of \nits HyperHelp(tm) and Xprinter(tm) demo for downloading.\n\nThis demo showcases the two products in the form of a \ndiagram editor called DE.\n\nDownload the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself:\n\n\t o Complete on-line context sensitive help system.\n\n\t o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript.\n\n\t o Rotated Text support!\n\n\t o Source code for the demo is provided.\n\nThe demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9).\n\nThere are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory:\nSun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x)\nHP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9)\n\nIf you have any questions about the demo, send an\ne-mail to: support@bristol.com.\n\nIf you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...) \nplease send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com.\n\nRemember to use binary mode!\n\n\nWhat are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on......\n---------------------------------------------------------\nBristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of\nits popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.\n\n\t\t\t    HyperHelp 3.0\n\t\t\t    -------------\nHyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context\nsensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one\nline function call, application developers can access the\nfull features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on\ntheir development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,\nproject, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.\nThis allows a documentation department to maintain a single\nset of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and\nOpen Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. \nAnd with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!\n\nNew features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character\nbased viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History\nwindow.\n\n\t\t\t     Xprinter 2.0\n\t\t\t     ------------\nXprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated\nprinter support to their existing/new X based applications\nvery easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the\ndisplay and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code\nfor drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for\nour demo and see Xprinter in action.\n\nIf you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support\nto your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier\nthis year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that\nresulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology\nfor UNIX SVR4.2.\n\n\nFeel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about\nHyperHelp and Xprinter. \n\nIf you have any questions or comments, send them to us at:\ninfo@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.\n\n\t\t\t\tHappy demoing,\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe staff at Bristol Technology"
