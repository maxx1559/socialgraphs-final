Shipping\n|> to Virginia from Cleveland was around $20 for 12 pounds, and C.O.D.\n|> was $8.00, as opposed to $4.50 for UPS.\n\nI'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I\nbuy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I\nonly pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to\nUPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg.\nI will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the\nright box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also\ntell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.\n\nOther things to watch out for/consider:\n\n\tThe rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.\n\n\tFor a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate\n\tof $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the\n\tsame weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many\n\tcities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox\n\toperator told me I was not telling the truth about\n\tcompetitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them\n\tbefore with NO problems), etc. Right.\n\n\tA COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local\n\tMailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the\n\tremade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the\n\tUPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)\n\n\tFor packages over $100, they charge you about double over\n\twhat UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had\n\ta claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)\n\thave told horror stories about them...\n\n\tAll package traces have to be done through Mailbox by\n\tMailbox.\n\n\tOur local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I\n\tasked him why their rates were stratospheric compared\n\tto direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...\n\n\tTheir UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy\n\tair rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!\n\n\tUPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!\n\t\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)",

It\nhas been used for 1 season on my sailboat. \n\t\n\tAll parts are included as well as the installation\ninstructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There\nis no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer\nwas mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.\nSo it led a \"sheltered\" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside\nthe hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole\ndrilled into your hull.\n\n\tIt is fully waterproof and fits into a 2\" hole in a bulkhead\n(that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a\npowerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has\nan adjustable shallow water alarm built in. \n\n\tI am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that\noutputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine\nand is very stable.\n\n\n\tIt is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.\n\n\n\tThe first 80$ takes it, or best offer. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tJohn R.

        "content": "********************[ PC Game For Sale ]******************\n\nWaxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade (5.25\")\t\t   $30\n\nBy the same folks who brought you Elvira I & II.  I played\nElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made\na very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\nyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported\nwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \n\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \n\n*********************************************************\n\n- All prices include shipping.\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\n- US buyers only please.\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\n  priority USPS.\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\nget the game.

Bulk mailers regulary \neither send their databases to be \"cleaned\" by the NCOA, which if you've\nmoved recently, will revert back to the original \"xxx Cool\", and in large\nmailings, there will likely be a dupe of you, and they'll pick the first, and use the\nothers for future mailings.\n \nBTW, our list is currently one of the hottest lists for actual buyers of\na MS Windows utility product in the $100 range, and is available through\nDirect Media in CT., at $0.10 per name.  Please let your direct mail\nmarketing rep. know about this..  Thanks.\n \nTEd\n>\n>  --- Matthew Caprile    || Hey, I only speak for myself !

Here are the\nstats (from memory and the manual):\n\n-  360x360 dot-printing for hi-res graphics, etc.\n-  VERY fast (up to 192 cps) printing in \"printer-controlled\" (as\n\topposed to Windows driver-controlled) printing\n-  Bidirectional printing for faster processing speed\n-  5 fonts (\"courier\",\"prestige\",\"bold ps\",\"script\",\"sans serif\")\n-  Epson LQ-2500 and IBM Proprinter X24 printer emulation\n-  Can accept single sheets, envelopes, and 3 non-carbon copies by\n\tfriction feed\n-  Front or bottom paper feed\n-  6KB buffer\n\nI will send a sample document and a printed GIF/JPEG file to anyone\nwho wishes to send a SASE.  With purchase (prepaid, please!), I will\ninclude the following accessories:\n\n-  Manual\n-  cable (Centronics)\n-  remaining stack of tractor-fed paper (about .4\")\n-  FREE copy of Windows printer driver (unless this is illegal, or if\n\tit is included with Windows)\n-  FREE unregistered DOS shareware program ($2 registration, I think)\n\tthat apparently offers some word processing capabilities\n\tfrom DOS\n\nThe last two will be on a disk (either size).  I am asking for around\n$165, but I am open to any (reasonable) offers.  I am a college\nstudent, so I cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a\nconsiderable portion of the money from this printer.  This price\nincludes all above items, and shipping (probably UPS) is included as\nwell.  I have the original box, but only one of the original Styrofoam\nend pieces.  I will use a towel on the other end (you get a free towel\ntoo!!).  Worked fine getting it here.  The whole shebang might not fit\nin the original box; I will figure this out after the offers come in.\nEmail any questions and offers.\t\t-Jon.\n--\njmatkins@midway.uchicago.edu  | jmatkins@ellis.uchicago.edu",

I attempted to \ncall them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number.\nIt took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,\nbut they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to their\nmanager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call\nyet. But I was able to get their address from their front desk.\nShould I just go ahead and send the package?

        "subject": "TCD-D3 DAT Walkman For Sale",
        "content": "I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT\nWalkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am\npaying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it\nis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the\nmost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)\n\n        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and\nhere's what he told me:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is what is included:\n        - TCD-D3 DATman.\n        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8\" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for\n          analog output.\n        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).\n        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\n        - Rechargable battery.\n\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\n\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\n\n        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little\nwhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point\nout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and\nhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine\nthat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher\nConspiracy for their recent live album.)\n\n        Bryan Davis says:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels\nin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported\nproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        'nuff said.\n\n        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\n\n        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,\nby the way.)\n\n        Anyway, if you're interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.\n\n-- \nJohn Davison\ndavisonj@ecn.purdue.edu",

I attempted\nto cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late and\nthe company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truth\nwhich I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back as\nclose as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...\n\nNishika 3D camera\tIt takes very good picture, never been opended\n\t\t\tor used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring\n\t\t\tcase, film, and a instruction video. It has four\n\t\t\tlens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm\n\t\t\tfilm.\n\nJewelry\t\t\tIt came with the package as additional gift.\n\nBahama vacation voucher\tThe voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.\n\t\t\tThe users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person\n\t\t\tper-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is\n\t\t\t_not_ included.\n\nLas Vegas, Reno, Orlando\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and\n\t\t\t\thotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.\n\t\t\t\tMeals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not\n\t\t\t\tincluded. The voucher is good for all 3\n\t\t\t\tlocations, but you can't travel to all 3\n\t\t\t\tplaces at once.\n\nCancun, Mexico\t\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel\n\t\t\taccomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and\n\t\t\tground transfer, hotel tax is not included as\n\t\t\tusual.\n\nI paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you\nmake your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell\nthe whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation\nvouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric\nIf you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers\nas gift.\n\nIf you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected\nto be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. \nTrust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is \nonly one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them \nback, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper \nprice. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three \nmonths to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your\ncredit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit \ncard company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them\nfrom me for a cheaper price.\n\nIf you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really\nwish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with\nyour offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.\nMore details could be given if you wish.\n\nPlease contact me at koutd@hirama.hiram.edu\n\nDouglas Kou\nHiram College\ne-mail address--- koutd@hirama.hiram.edu",

The seller insisted\nthat it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it\nis bad. Is this reasonable?\n\nBasically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of \nthe thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.\n\nI would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my\ne-mail address.\n\nI know there is such a risk that you could lose money.

Yes, yes, I know Motorola\nHTs are bullet-proof, unbreakable, plutonium-based \nindestructable -- you can drive a tank over them and they'll\nstill work.  But just how often does that come up?  Why are hams\nwilling (and they *are*) to spend the price of a synthaszied\ndual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig???  Note: this is not\na flame; as I said, I'm sure this is a good deal for this rig.\nI'm just amazed that it *is* a good deal.  I would have guessed\nthat a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual-\nbander to a ham, no matter how durable. Just shows you how wrong\n*I* can be.\n\nMike, N4PDY\n\n******************************\n* These are my opinions only.*\n******************************",

New lens, but I guess it'd\nbe best to call it a \"demo\" since I did not get the literature, box or\nwarranty cards.  $30.\n \nVivitar 2X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses.  Pretty cute \"flip back\"\ntang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses - and bodies.\nIt will even couple (and double) a non-AI lens to an AI body.  $15.\n \nPentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens.  Well actually it's a Super-Takumar which\nis what they all were back then.  Very mint condition.  $25. Nice hard\ncase for this lens $5 more..\n \nAlpex 135/2.8 lens.  Beautifully made, all metal construction with fine\noptics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this with\nstrap can be added..call it $7 more.\n \nVivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285\neclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure.\n$30.\n \nUniversal \"Roamer 63\" folding old \"bellows\" camera with leather case.\nUses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutter\nrelease.  Decent shape.  $20.\n \nWeston 540 lightmeter.  Nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is a\ngood cross check to built in meters.  $7 with case and strap.\n \nAnd finally..the \"gems\"\n \nPentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F2.8 lens.  This is the little\n(and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses,\nbut try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with\nsplit image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70.\n \nOlympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mm\nlens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  I\nthink this was the predecessor to the XA - and it's nearly all metal.\nI won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell.  $60.\n \nOlympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, and\nTokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice to\nmint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the film\nadvance lever.

A description follows:\n\nOkidata 180 printer including cables for both IBM compatibles (Centronics\nparallel) and Commodore (RS-232 - round).  Also includes power cable, manual,\nand a handful of computer paper to get you started.  This is a 9-pin printer. \nI recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon.  A print sample \ncan be provided upon request.  This is a very dependable printer - it never\njams or does \"weird\" things.  I have used it with a Commodore for about 3 years\nand am now using it with my 486sx.  I use mainly WordPerfect 5.1 (see next\npost) for which I got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the \nOkidata 180 in Epson FX mode. \n\nWhen I got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (I got mine\nfrom Tenex brand new - for a Christmas present).  I would like to get about\n$100 or so for it.  If you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring\n(E-Mail) and make an offer.\n\n- Kevin Harter",

        "content": "Fellow netters,\n\nI just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out\nthere (even outside of Iowa).  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting\nspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the \"So-and-so is a thief\"\nposts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be\nnice to hear some good news once in a while.\n\nAfter seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a\nrequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50\nin his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded\nmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. \nImagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a\nmessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed\nthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\ntransfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's\nbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good\nones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat\nyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my\nsoftware from him.\n\nBravo, Mr. Miller!\n\n- Kevin Harter",

Check with a local car\nstereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units \nserial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I \ndon't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people\nwho damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.\n\nAs to deterring theft:\n\nWhen I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800\nnumber.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most\npeople who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that\nmatter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck\nthey couldn't use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial\nnumbers do catch theives.\n\nJust a thought,\nMichael",

        "content": "\"Jack Previdi\" <p00020@psilink.com> writes, in reply to Dorothy Heydt\nreminding us that advertising is not done on Internet:\n\n\t   As a matter of fact D.J., it does make a difference.\n\t   Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,\n\t   many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial\n\t   use of Internet is no more.\n\nJack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial\npurposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is\nokay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet\nwho have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.\n\n\t   Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only\n\t   by our innate good taste and no have no \"administrator\" to \n\t   guide(?) us.\n\nI suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not\nin anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention\nit didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but that\ndoesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb\nthe other patrons.\n\nYou're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many\nacademic and military, who get irritable about a network for which\nthey pay with tax and grant money carrying private business\nadvertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like\neverywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but\nthey're here.\n\nNo doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become\ngrotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is\nconfined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like\nmisc.writing.\n\n\nElizabeth Willey",

For those who've not\nhad the pleasure:\n\nIt is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice\nprocessor.  What can it do with your voice?  It can pitch-shift it (change the\nnotes you sing).  It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one\ntime).  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what\nyou say alone and intelligible.  This works well for a \"computerized\" sounding\nsinger, or robot voice.  For those of you who just thought about that, yes -\nyou can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes -\nI'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically.  For an input,\nit takes both: XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4\" cables.  For output, you can have\na combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the\noriginal signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired).  It has preset\nsetups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences.  It has a couple\nof light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly.  Even when we\ndon't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio.\nThe manual is included.  I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but\nit has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten.\n-- \n      oooooooo       o     o                      Steve Hitch\n     oo      o     oo    oo       My opinions are my own.

The voucher is good for all 3\n\t\t\t\tlocations, but you can't travel to all 3\n\t\t\t\tplaces at once.\n\nCancun, Mexico\t\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel\n\t\t\taccomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and\n\t\t\tground transfer, hotel tax is not included as\n\t\t\tusual.\n\n\nAsking for $500 or best offer...\n\nI paid $697 for the whole package. And it is too late for me to get the \nrefund. I would sell it for $500 for the whole package. Details could be \nprovided by request. I do wish to sell the whole package at once. So if \nyou are just looking for the vacation vouchers, I don't care if you \nsell the camera to other for a higher price. If you are interested in \nthe camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift.\n\nSome of you might receive a letter in your mail box which says that you \nare selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out \nof five awards. Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as \nI did. There is only one award which will be given away. So don't \nbother even to call them back, if you are really interested, you could \nget it from me for a cheaper price. And you could receive the package \nwithin a week ( I waited three months to get my first and final packages). \nAlso, they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay \nfor the interest to the credit card company. So why spend more than you\nshould when you could get them from me for a cheaper price.\n\nIf you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really\nwish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with\nyour offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.\nMore details could be given if you wish.\n\nPlease contact me at koutd@hirama.hiram.edu\n\nDouglas Kou\nHiram College\ne-mail address--- koutd@hirama.hiram.edu",

I really want to sell them, so make me an offer for\nthe whole package. If you are participating in a award, $697 is how\nmuch you would end up paying. And I strongly believe that you would\nget the same award as I do. If you are interested in those items,\nyou could get them from me for a cheaper price.\n\nLet me know, and make me an offer.

Because\n\tit's auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette\n\tdeck does, so it's not very good for splice-type editing.

Adjustable sound on sound,\n\tand socket for remote control (I don't know where you'd find one, but\n\tthey used to make 'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.

Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff\n\tyou expect when buying like-new merchandise.  I'm selling it because I\n\tnow have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the\n\tKX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.\n\n\tPrice:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.\n\n\n\tExcalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen\n\twrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too\n\tmany cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very\n\tstraight and in excellent condition.\n\n\tPrice:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.

This one's \n\ttouchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless\n\tI swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a\n\tgood ST-4096 in the deal.\n\n\tIntel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem.\n\n\nThis is not a complete list, but it's close.

The question is how much that quality\nis worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service\n\n>This radio can hear a repeater thats 40 miles away without\n> an antenna.\n\nOk, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is\n\"good enough\", and how much is someone willing to pay for it?\nA good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial\nquality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and\nperformance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*?\nOnly the individual involved can answer that question, and each\nham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth\n4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed\nthat folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to\nspend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over\na Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality\ngear is \"good enough\".

It\n                  includes all the standard fun things about\n                  flight simulators, like taking off and landing\n                  on carriers, flying -- of course -- and better\n                  yet, it is also a battle simulator.  It is a\n                  lot of fun, indeed.\n                o An IBM PC or compatible with at least 640K, and\n                  dual floppies or a hard drive is required.\n \n \n                o WinWay Resume for Windows\n                o Includes all original packaging, manuals\n                  and disks\n                o Original price: $50.00\n                o My asking price: $35.00\n                o WinWay Resume is a resume writing program for\n                  Windows.  It is an excellent program (it got\n                  me a job!) and running under the Window's\n                  interface makes it very, very easy to use.  All\n                  you do is answer a few questions, and print out\n                  the results.  In just a few minutes, you have a\n                  beautifully and professionally designed resume.\n                o An IBM PC with Windows 3.0 or later installed\n                  and 1 MB of free hard disk space is required.\n \n \n                o More Typefaces\n                o Includes all original packaging, manuals\n                  and disks\n                o Original price: $99.99\n                o My asking price: $30.00\n                o More Typefaces is a package of three TypeType\n                  font families (for a total of twelve fonts) for\n                  Windows 3.1.  The fonts included are: Marque,\n                  Crystal and Architech, and of course italic,\n                  bold and bold italic versions are included with\n                  all those fonts.  Because of the unique font\n                  software included with the package, these fonts\n                  can be used with either the MoreFonts typeface\n                  program, Adobe Type Manager, TrueType, GeoWorks,\n                  Express Publisher and CorelDRAW.\n                o An IBM PC with Windows 3.1 and a hard disk is\n                  required if you want to use the typefaces in\n                  TrueType format.  For all other formats, an\n                  IBM PC and a hard disk with one of the programs\n                  listed above is required.\n \n \n        If you are interested in any of these programs, please\neither leave me email or call Kirk Peterson at (303) 494-7951,\nanytime.  If I don't answer, leave me a message on my answering\nmachine and I'll call you back.

Worksheet \n     size is limited to 64 columns by 256 rows, there is no\n     translation facility (for importing data from other\n     packages), and the Student Edition does not write files \n     that can be accessed by Release 2.01.  Includes manual,\n     original distribution diskettes (5 1/4\" - 360K), and key\n     board templates.\n\n\no Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00\n     This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 \n     & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels \n     & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater \n     & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, \n     doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument \n     panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body \n     electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). \n     These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals.  They are for \n     model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that \n     applies to other years as well.\n\n\no Miscellaneous Darkroom Equipment ........................ $75.00\n     Solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and \n     timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc.\n     printing masks.

Handmade, with very interesting\n     dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around \n     1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant \n     piece of furniture, but too big (60\" long, 37\" tall, 24\" \n     deep) for our little Cape Cod house.\n\n\nWill deliver pricier items (ie, over $10) anywhere in the Rochester \narea.

I know the truth\nwhich I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back as\nclose as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...\n\nNishika 3D camera\tIt takes very good picture, never been opended\n\t\t\tor used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring\n\t\t\tcase, film, and a instruction video. It has four\n\t\t\tlens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm\n\t\t\tfilm.\n\nJewelry\t\t\tIt came with the package as additional gift.\n\nBahama vacation voucher\tThe voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.\n\t\t\tThe users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person\n\t\t\tper-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is\n\t\t\t_not_ included.\n\nLas Vegas, Reno, Orlando\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and\n\t\t\t\thotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.\n\t\t\t\tMeals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not\n\t\t\t\tincluded. The voucher is good for all 3\n\t\t\t\tlocations, but you can't travel to all 3\n\t\t\t\tplaces at once.\n\nCancun, Mexico\t\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel\n\t\t\taccomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and\n\t\t\tground transfer, hotel tax is not included as\n\t\t\tusual.\n\nI paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you\nmake your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell\nthe whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation\nvouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric\nIf you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers\nas gift.\n\nIf you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected\nto be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. \nTrust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is \nonly one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them \nback, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper \nprice. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three \nmonths to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your\ncredit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit \ncard company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them\nfrom me for a cheaper price.\n\nIf you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really\nwish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with\nyour offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.\nMore details could be given if you wish.\n\nPlease contact me at koutd@hirama.hiram.edu\n\nDouglas Kou\nHiram College\ne-mail address--- koutd@hirama.hiram.edu",

        "content": "Computer Equipment Garage Sale:\n\nI've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff\nthat is broken or not being used by me.  I've put together a list and\nindicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I\nam very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for\nsome CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy \ndisks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically \nanything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  \nMake me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... \nI really want to get rid of this stuff...\n\nOk, Here's the list:\n\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy\n\tat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem \n\tto get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The\n\tguy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk \n\tDoctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) \n\tI was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to \n\thim. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) \n\tso maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't\n\twork so I'm trying to minimize my losses.\t~$45\n\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.\n\tI bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different\n\tmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD\n\t(I have one for each drive) will be included.\t~$45\n\n40 Meg SONY 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism \n\tis completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and\n\thad a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the\n\tcomputer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which\n\twas not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller\n\tcard is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a \n\tproject.\t~$20\n\n65 Meg Seagate 5.25\" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought\n\tthis drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that\n\tI could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,\n\tand that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending\n\tproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, \n\tlooking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I\n\taccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the \n\tdrive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good\n\tat soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed\n\tup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on\n\tme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,\n\tworth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,\n\tExcel, and many others) \n\tI think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all\n\tthe software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only \n\task that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry\n\twhen I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't \n\thave time to play with it any more.\t~$65\n\nAT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know\n\twhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I\n\thave some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an\n\tAT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  \n\tworking order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how \n\tthis is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.\n\nMotorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone \n\tis interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I\n\thad trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the\n\tmanufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without \n\tanother controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the\n\tprices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.\t~$65\n\nCGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (although\n\tI think I was using a bad monitor)\t~$5\n\n5.25\"\t360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, \n\tbecause when I took it out of the PC, it was working!\t\t~$25\n\n5.25\" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to \n\twork.  Came out of same PC as above.\t~$25\n\n5.25\"\tFloppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don't\n\teven know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't have\n\tany method of testing them.\n\t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's another\n\t\t\tnumber on it: 2626-361723.\n\t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's also\n\t\t\tanother number on it: H3649-101457\n\t\tToshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one \n\t\t\tabove.\n\tEach Drive ~$10\n\n3.5\" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but I\n\tthink it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but I\n\tsuppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number\n\tDFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35\n\nMFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no way\n\tof testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit\n\tcard with a floppy controller built in.\t~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for\n\tthe 16-bit card w/floppy.\n\nInteresting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is,\n\tstandard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No.\n\tD1181-80020\t\t~$10\n\n\n\nI've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many \nsatisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I \nusually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) \nand the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.\n\nWell, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you \ncan convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate\nto throw away stuff...\n\n\n-Wayne\n\nwdempsey@athena.mit.edu\n(617)-225-9349",

Or are\nthe\n>lenses, etc. all \"tuned\" for the refractive index of water?\n>\nI have had a Nikon L35AW since 1988. Unfortunately it is no longer\nmade. It is a P & S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. It\nis not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and\ndusty conditions. It takes AA batteries (hooray). It has the solid,\nheavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have\nbeen able to give it. This includes a lot of water (rain, river and\nsea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon\nagainst a mugger. Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap\ndidn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera\ndid. This is my, \"never be without a camera\" camera. The current\nwater-resistant (Sport Touch I think is the name) model is nothing\nlike as solid or well sealed.\n\nDon Mackie - his opinions",

It weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high.  I think\nthey used to run a Prime system off of it.  Best offer over $75, but you \nneed to come pick it up.  Use this to run your house from your solar panels.\n\nI will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff.\n-- \nPaul Amaranth  Manager User Services - office: (313) 370 4541 (also voicemail)\n(internet)     amaranth@vela.acs.oakland.edu  |    This space \n(bitnet)       amaranth@oakland               |    temporarily\n(uucp)         ...!uunet!umich!vela!amaranth  |      empty",

These are great amps, and I've never\n    had a minute's trouble with either of them.  I've been running them on\n    high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased\n    with them in that setup, but I've also run them on low end before, and\n    they perform quite well in that situation as well.  I'm trying to sell\n    them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford 650.  I already\n    own a Power 300, and I've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked\n    in cars.\n\n    I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was\n    $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come\n    down on the price a little bit.\n\n\n(1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,\n    and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.\n    This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into\n    2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end\n    before where it did very well.\n\n    I'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on\n    it.\n\n\n**** Please direct questions/replies to hacker@krusty.gtri.gatech.edu ****\n\n==============================================================================\n== Chase Hacker                          \"Fortune presents gifts not        ==\n== chase@cc.gatech.edu                    according to the book.

        "content": "Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer:\nI have an SQ-80 for sale.  The SQ-80 is a powerful performance\noriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\".\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\n    panning for each voice\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\n    access to all eight voices\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \n    modulation sources and routings.\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\n    the SQ-80.\n\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\n\n>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\nto use so I have avoided it.\n\nREASON FOR SALE:\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I\nrecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a\npowerful but economical master keyboard.\n\nPRICING AND TERMS:\nI paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept\n$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of \npatches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the \noriginal Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual.\n\nPrice:    Asking $650.00 (everything)\nShipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCraig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systems\ne-mail:  craigv@rad.verbex.com                            119 Russell Street\nphone: (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

A month ago I made a deal with him over the\nnet.  I was to sell him some memory, in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu.\nI thought the deal was great, so I went on with it.  \n\nI sent him the memory COD FOR $100.  He was then suppose to send me the cpu.\nI receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent the\ncpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU.\n\nI send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or\nwhat address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.)\nHe never reply my mail.  \n\nI finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't get\nthrought, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply.\nI call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he had\nsend out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it\nto.  \n\nHe said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day.\nTo my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, he\nnever reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every\nof my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)\n\nNow:  I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone.  I am also still\n      emailing him, but he won't reply my mail.\n\nSo if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him.\nhe can be reach at:\n\t\t\tDana Weick\n\t\t\t4238 W Las Palmaritas\n\t\t\tPhoenix, AZ 85051\n    (602)925-6123 in the day time this is his business number.\n    (602)842-2145 in the evenings this is his home number.\n\n\nhis email address is:\n\t\t\tweick@master.lds-az.loral.com\n*******This is our deal\n\nFrom weick@master.lds-az.loral.com Wed Mar 17 20:09:20 1993\n\n>> \n>> 72-pin SIMMS aren't hot sellers, I pick them up on the upgrade market for\n>> $140-160 quite often.

Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge,\nbending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you\nplug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior to\nshipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real\nsympathetic! \n \nIf you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed, \nDON'T GUESS!\n\n\n********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:****************************\n\nI call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was \nbusy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an house\nwent by, Weick didn't called.

I am asking around $70 with shipping\nincluded.\n\nWinSong for Windows:\n\nComposer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one.\n\nIt's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move\nand copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition.\n\nIt's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder.\nUp to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward\nand stop.\n\nIt plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set,\nsaxophone, clarinet, organ, and many.\n\nYou do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual\nis handy. For musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and\nstifling aspect.\n\nAlmost NEW (one week OLD), unregistered\n$70 (including shipping) OBO (please be reasonable)",

Shipping\n|> to Virginia from Cleveland was around $20 for 12 pounds, and C.O.D.\n|> was $8.00, as opposed to $4.50 for UPS.\n\nI'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I\nbuy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I\nonly pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to\nUPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg.\nI will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the\nright box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also\ntell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.\n\nOther things to watch out for/consider:\n\n\tThe rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.\n\n\tFor a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate\n\tof $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the\n\tsame weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many\n\tcities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox\n\toperator told me I was not telling the truth about\n\tcompetitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them\n\tbefore with NO problems), etc. Right.\n\n\tA COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local\n\tMailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the\n\tremade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the\n\tUPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)\n\n\tFor packages over $100, they charge you about double over\n\twhat UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had\n\ta claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)\n\thave told horror stories about them...\n\n\tAll package traces have to be done through Mailbox by\n\tMailbox.\n\n\tOur local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I\n\tasked him why their rates were stratospheric compared\n\tto direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...\n\n\tTheir UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy\n\tair rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!\n\n\tUPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!\n\t\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)",

It\nhas been used for 1 season on my sailboat. \n\t\n\tAll parts are included as well as the installation\ninstructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There\nis no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer\nwas mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.\nSo it led a \"sheltered\" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside\nthe hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole\ndrilled into your hull.\n\n\tIt is fully waterproof and fits into a 2\" hole in a bulkhead\n(that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a\npowerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has\nan adjustable shallow water alarm built in. \n\n\tI am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that\noutputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine\nand is very stable.\n\n\n\tIt is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.\n\n\n\tThe first 80$ takes it, or best offer. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tJohn R.

It prints with the\n        quality of a laser printer, but for a fraction of both\n        the inital cost and he long term cost (that is,\n        replacement of ink cartridges as opposed to replacement\n        of toner).  The printer prints at a maximum of 300*300\n        (D)ots (P)er (I)nch (D.P.I.) on many different types\n        and sizes of paper, including envelopes and\n        transperencies.  Printer prints in both landscape and\n        portrait modes.  Printer can accept up to two\n        cartridges giving it things like more memory or\n        additional fonts.  Printer works excellently with\n        Windows and DOS and brings TrueType to its full\n        potential.\n \n        I originally purchased the printer for $375.00.  Make me\n        an offer, but I would prefer to stay in the $300.00\n        range.

        "content": "********************[ PC Game For Sale ]******************\n\nWaxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade (5.25\")\t\t   $30\n\nBy the same folks who brought you Elvira I & II.  I played\nElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made\na very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\nyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported\nwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \n\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \n\n*********************************************************\n\n- All prices include shipping.\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\n- US buyers only please.\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\n  priority USPS.\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\nget the game.

Here are the\nstats (from memory and the manual):\n\n-  360x360 dot-printing for hi-res graphics, etc.\n-  VERY fast (up to 192 cps) printing in \"printer-controlled\" (as\n\topposed to Windows driver-controlled) printing\n-  Bidirectional printing for faster processing speed\n-  5 fonts (\"courier\",\"prestige\",\"bold ps\",\"script\",\"sans serif\")\n-  Epson LQ-2500 and IBM Proprinter X24 printer emulation\n-  Can accept single sheets, envelopes, and 3 non-carbon copies by\n\tfriction feed\n-  Front or bottom paper feed\n-  6KB buffer\n\nI will send a sample document and a printed GIF/JPEG file to anyone\nwho wishes to send a SASE.  With purchase (prepaid, please!), I will\ninclude the following accessories:\n\n-  Manual\n-  cable (Centronics)\n-  remaining stack of tractor-fed paper (about .4\")\n-  FREE copy of Windows printer driver (unless this is illegal, or if\n\tit is included with Windows)\n-  FREE unregistered DOS shareware program ($2 registration, I think)\n\tthat apparently offers some word processing capabilities\n\tfrom DOS\n\nThe last two will be on a disk (either size).  I am asking for around\n$165, but I am open to any (reasonable) offers.  I am a college\nstudent, so I cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a\nconsiderable portion of the money from this printer.  This price\nincludes all above items, and shipping (probably UPS) is included as\nwell.  I have the original box, but only one of the original Styrofoam\nend pieces.  I will use a towel on the other end (you get a free towel\ntoo!!).  Worked fine getting it here.  The whole shebang might not fit\nin the original box; I will figure this out after the offers come in.\nEmail any questions and offers.\t\t-Jon.\n--\njmatkins@midway.uchicago.edu  | jmatkins@ellis.uchicago.edu",

They mislabled my address and I did not receive my package\nuntil one month ago. I was mad and angry about how it took them\nso long to get my package. So I wrote them a letter and requested\nfor a refund. They never return my letter. I was lucky enough to\nfind out their telephone number through operator and received the\npackage. I immediately returned the package and wrote them another\nletter to ask for refund. The package was returned because they\naddress they put on the package was incorrect. I attempted to \ncall them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number.\nIt took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,\nbut they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to their\nmanager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call\nyet. But I was able to get their address from their front desk.\nShould I just go ahead and send the package? Or should I waite until\nthey call me back?\n\nI know there are several people on the net has experience with the\nsame company. I would like to know how they got their money back.\nIf you have similar experience, please advise me.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDouglas Kou\nHiram College",

        "subject": "TCD-D3 DAT Walkman For Sale",
        "content": "I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT\nWalkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am\npaying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it\nis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the\nmost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)\n\n        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and\nhere's what he told me:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is what is included:\n        - TCD-D3 DATman.\n        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8\" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for\n          analog output.\n        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).\n        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\n        - Rechargable battery.\n\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\n\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\n\n        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little\nwhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point\nout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and\nhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine\nthat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher\nConspiracy for their recent live album.)\n\n        Bryan Davis says:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels\nin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported\nproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        'nuff said.\n\n        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\n\n        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,\nby the way.)\n\n        Anyway, if you're interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.\n\n-- \nJohn Davison\ndavisonj@ecn.purdue.edu",

Here is the describtion of the package...\n\nNishika 3D camera\tIt takes very good picture, never been opended\n\t\t\tor used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring\n\t\t\tcase, film, and a instruction video. It has four\n\t\t\tlens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm\n\t\t\tfilm.\n\nJewelry\t\t\tIt came with the package as additional gift.\n\nBahama vacation voucher\tThe voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.\n\t\t\tThe users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person\n\t\t\tper-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is\n\t\t\t_not_ included.\n\nLas Vegas, Reno, Orlando\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and\n\t\t\t\thotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.\n\t\t\t\tMeals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not\n\t\t\t\tincluded.

Meals and\n\t\t\tground transfer, hotel tax is not included as\n\t\t\tusual.\n\nI paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you\nmake your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell\nthe whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation\nvouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric\nIf you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers\nas gift.\n\nIf you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected\nto be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. \nTrust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is \nonly one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them \nback, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper \nprice. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three \nmonths to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your\ncredit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit \ncard company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them\nfrom me for a cheaper price.\n\nIf you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really\nwish to get this over with.

The seller insisted\nthat it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it\nis bad. Is this reasonable?\n\nBasically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of \nthe thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.\n\nI would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my\ne-mail address.\n\nI know there is such a risk that you could lose money.

New lens, but I guess it'd\nbe best to call it a \"demo\" since I did not get the literature, box or\nwarranty cards.  $30.\n \nVivitar 2X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses.  Pretty cute \"flip back\"\ntang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses - and bodies.\nIt will even couple (and double) a non-AI lens to an AI body.  $15.\n \nPentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens.  Well actually it's a Super-Takumar which\nis what they all were back then.  Very mint condition.  $25. Nice hard\ncase for this lens $5 more..\n \nAlpex 135/2.8 lens.  Beautifully made, all metal construction with fine\noptics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this with\nstrap can be added..call it $7 more.\n \nVivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285\neclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure.\n$30.\n \nUniversal \"Roamer 63\" folding old \"bellows\" camera with leather case.\nUses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutter\nrelease.  Decent shape.  $20.\n \nWeston 540 lightmeter.  Nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is a\ngood cross check to built in meters.  $7 with case and strap.\n \nAnd finally..the \"gems\"\n \nPentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F2.8 lens.  This is the little\n(and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses,\nbut try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with\nsplit image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70.\n \nOlympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mm\nlens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  I\nthink this was the predecessor to the XA - and it's nearly all metal.\nI won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell.  $60.\n \nOlympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, and\nTokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice to\nmint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the film\nadvance lever.  Lenses are perfect, and the Tokina is a very compact,\nand sharp lens.  $225 for the set.\n \n \nThat'll do to clean out some of the stuff.

That sounded\nmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. \nImagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a\nmessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed\nthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\ntransfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's\nbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good\nones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat\nyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my\nsoftware from him.\n\nBravo, Mr. Miller!\n\n- Kevin Harter",

Check with a local car\nstereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units \nserial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I \ndon't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people\nwho damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.\n\nAs to deterring theft:\n\nWhen I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800\nnumber.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most\npeople who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that\nmatter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck\nthey couldn't use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial\nnumbers do catch theives.\n\nJust a thought,\nMichael",

        "content": "\"Jack Previdi\" <p00020@psilink.com> writes, in reply to Dorothy Heydt\nreminding us that advertising is not done on Internet:\n\n\t   As a matter of fact D.J., it does make a difference.\n\t   Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,\n\t   many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial\n\t   use of Internet is no more.\n\nJack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial\npurposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is\nokay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet\nwho have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.\n\n\t   Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only\n\t   by our innate good taste and no have no \"administrator\" to \n\t   guide(?) us.\n\nI suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not\nin anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention\nit didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but that\ndoesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb\nthe other patrons.\n\nYou're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many\nacademic and military, who get irritable about a network for which\nthey pay with tax and grant money carrying private business\nadvertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like\neverywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but\nthey're here.\n\nNo doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become\ngrotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is\nconfined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like\nmisc.writing.\n\n\nElizabeth Willey",

For those who've not\nhad the pleasure:\n\nIt is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice\nprocessor.  What can it do with your voice?  It can pitch-shift it (change the\nnotes you sing).  It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one\ntime).  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what\nyou say alone and intelligible.  This works well for a \"computerized\" sounding\nsinger, or robot voice.  For those of you who just thought about that, yes -\nyou can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes -\nI'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically.  For an input,\nit takes both: XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4\" cables.  For output, you can have\na combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the\noriginal signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired).  It has preset\nsetups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences.  It has a couple\nof light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly.  Even when we\ndon't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio.\nThe manual is included.  I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but\nit has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten.\n-- \n      oooooooo       o     o                      Steve Hitch\n     oo      o     oo    oo       My opinions are my own.

Please read carefully.\n\n\nIn the MAKE OFFER department:\n\n\tWordPerfect 5.0, upgrade copy.  Includes all disks and all upgrade\n\tmanuals.  Best offer.\n\n\tBalance of Power, 1992 edition, for the Amiga.  With manual and reg.\n\tcard.  Best offer.\n\n\nIn the FOR SALE department:\n\n\tTechnics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel STEREO tape deck.  Because\n\tit's auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette\n\tdeck does, so it's not very good for splice-type editing.  However,\n\tI have used it effectively in \"tape studio\" applications for mastering,\n\tand it works great.  3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7\" reels.\n\tDual lighted VU meters with record indicators.  Full auto-reverse\n\tcapable (and the mechanism works, too!).  Adjustable sound on sound,\n\tand socket for remote control (I don't know where you'd find one, but\n\tthey used to make 'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.  This unit\n\tis in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got\n\tit--works perfectly.\n\n\tPrice:  $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below).\n\n\n\tPanasonic KX-P1624 printer.  24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both\n\ttext and graphics modes.  Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff\n\tyou expect when buying like-new merchandise.  I'm selling it because I\n\tnow have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the\n\tKX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.\n\n\tPrice:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.\n\n\n\tExcalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen\n\twrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too\n\tmany cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very\n\tstraight and in excellent condition.\n\n\tPrice:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft)\n\tavailable for an additional $40.00.\n\n\nTRADES:  I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now,\nso if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list:\n\n\tAmiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate\n\tDOS and Workbench.\n\n\t1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.\n\n\tAmiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).\n\n\tIBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's \n\ttouchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless\n\tI swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a\n\tgood ST-4096 in the deal.\n\n\tIntel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem.\n\n\nThis is not a complete list, but it's close.  If you've got something way off\nthe track of this list, it's probably not going to interest me at this point.\nEmail responses, please.",

The question is how much that quality\nis worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service\n\n>This radio can hear a repeater thats 40 miles away without\n> an antenna.\n\nOk, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is\n\"good enough\", and how much is someone willing to pay for it?\nA good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial\nquality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and\nperformance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*?\nOnly the individual involved can answer that question, and each\nham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth\n4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed\nthat folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to\nspend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over\na Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality\ngear is \"good enough\". To each his own...\n\n73... Mike, N4PDY\n\n******************************\n* These are my opinions only.*\n******************************",

Worksheet \n     size is limited to 64 columns by 256 rows, there is no\n     translation facility (for importing data from other\n     packages), and the Student Edition does not write files \n     that can be accessed by Release 2.01.  Includes manual,\n     original distribution diskettes (5 1/4\" - 360K), and key\n     board templates.\n\n\no Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00\n     This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 \n     & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels \n     & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater \n     & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, \n     doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument \n     panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body \n     electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). \n     These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals.  They are for \n     model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that \n     applies to other years as well.\n\n\no Miscellaneous Darkroom Equipment ........................ $75.00\n     Solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and \n     timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc.\n     printing masks.

Handmade, with very interesting\n     dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around \n     1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant \n     piece of furniture, but too big (60\" long, 37\" tall, 24\" \n     deep) for our little Cape Cod house.\n\n\nWill deliver pricier items (ie, over $10) anywhere in the Rochester \narea.

It came with wide angle flesh, carring\n\t\t\tcase, film, and a instruction video. It has four\n\t\t\tlens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm\n\t\t\tfilm.\n\nJewelry\t\t\tIt came with the package as additional gift.\n\nBahama vacation voucher\tThe voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.\n\t\t\tThe users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person\n\t\t\tper-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is\n\t\t\t_not_ included.\n\nLas Vegas, Reno, Orlando\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and\n\t\t\t\thotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.\n\t\t\t\tMeals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not\n\t\t\t\tincluded. The voucher is good for all 3\n\t\t\t\tlocations, but you can't travel to all 3\n\t\t\t\tplaces at once.\n\nCancun, Mexico\t\tThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel\n\t\t\taccomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and\n\t\t\tground transfer, hotel tax is not included as\n\t\t\tusual.\n\nI paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you\nmake your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell\nthe whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation\nvouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric\nIf you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers\nas gift.\n\nIf you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected\nto be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. \nTrust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is \nonly one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them \nback, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper \nprice. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three \nmonths to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your\ncredit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit \ncard company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them\nfrom me for a cheaper price.\n\nIf you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really\nwish to get this over with.

        "content": "Computer Equipment Garage Sale:\n\nI've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff\nthat is broken or not being used by me.  I've put together a list and\nindicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I\nam very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for\nsome CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy \ndisks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically \nanything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  \nMake me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... \nI really want to get rid of this stuff...\n\nOk, Here's the list:\n\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy\n\tat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem \n\tto get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The\n\tguy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk \n\tDoctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) \n\tI was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to \n\thim. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) \n\tso maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't\n\twork so I'm trying to minimize my losses.\t~$45\n\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.\n\tI bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different\n\tmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD\n\t(I have one for each drive) will be included.\t~$45\n\n40 Meg SONY 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism \n\tis completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and\n\thad a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the\n\tcomputer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which\n\twas not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller\n\tcard is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a \n\tproject.\t~$20\n\n65 Meg Seagate 5.25\" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought\n\tthis drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that\n\tI could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,\n\tand that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending\n\tproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, \n\tlooking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I\n\taccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the \n\tdrive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good\n\tat soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed\n\tup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on\n\tme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,\n\tworth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,\n\tExcel, and many others) \n\tI think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all\n\tthe software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only \n\task that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry\n\twhen I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't \n\thave time to play with it any more.\t~$65\n\nAT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know\n\twhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I\n\thave some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an\n\tAT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  \n\tworking order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how \n\tthis is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.\n\nMotorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone \n\tis interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I\n\thad trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the\n\tmanufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without \n\tanother controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the\n\tprices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.\t~$65\n\nCGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (although\n\tI think I was using a bad monitor)\t~$5\n\n5.25\"\t360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, \n\tbecause when I took it out of the PC, it was working!\t\t~$25\n\n5.25\" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to \n\twork.  Came out of same PC as above.\t~$25\n\n5.25\"\tFloppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don't\n\teven know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't have\n\tany method of testing them.\n\t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's another\n\t\t\tnumber on it: 2626-361723.\n\t\tPanasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's also\n\t\t\tanother number on it: H3649-101457\n\t\tToshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one \n\t\t\tabove.\n\tEach Drive ~$10\n\n3.5\" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but I\n\tthink it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but I\n\tsuppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number\n\tDFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35\n\nMFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no way\n\tof testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit\n\tcard with a floppy controller built in.\t~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for\n\tthe 16-bit card w/floppy.\n\nInteresting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is,\n\tstandard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No.\n\tD1181-80020\t\t~$10\n\n\n\nI've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many \nsatisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I \nusually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) \nand the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.\n\nWell, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you \ncan convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate\nto throw away stuff...\n\n\n-Wayne\n\nwdempsey@athena.mit.edu\n(617)-225-9349",

Or are\nthe\n>lenses, etc. all \"tuned\" for the refractive index of water?\n>\nI have had a Nikon L35AW since 1988. Unfortunately it is no longer\nmade. It is a P & S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. It\nis not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and\ndusty conditions. It takes AA batteries (hooray). It has the solid,\nheavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have\nbeen able to give it. This includes a lot of water (rain, river and\nsea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon\nagainst a mugger. Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap\ndidn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera\ndid. This is my, \"never be without a camera\" camera. The current\nwater-resistant (Sport Touch I think is the name) model is nothing\nlike as solid or well sealed.\n\nDon Mackie - his opinions",

These are great amps, and I've never\n    had a minute's trouble with either of them.  I've been running them on\n    high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased\n    with them in that setup, but I've also run them on low end before, and\n    they perform quite well in that situation as well.  I'm trying to sell\n    them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford 650.  I already\n    own a Power 300, and I've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked\n    in cars.\n\n    I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was\n    $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come\n    down on the price a little bit.\n\n\n(1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,\n    and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.\n    This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into\n    2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end\n    before where it did very well.\n\n    I'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on\n    it.\n\n\n**** Please direct questions/replies to hacker@krusty.gtri.gatech.edu ****\n\n==============================================================================\n== Chase Hacker                          \"Fortune presents gifts not        ==\n== chase@cc.gatech.edu                    according to the book.

        "subject": "Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer for sale",
        "content": "Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer:\nI have an SQ-80 for sale.  The SQ-80 is a powerful performance\noriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\".\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\n    panning for each voice\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\n    access to all eight voices\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \n    modulation sources and routings.\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\n    the SQ-80.\n\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\n\n>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\nto use so I have avoided it.\n\nREASON FOR SALE:\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I\nrecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a\npowerful but economical master keyboard.\n\nPRICING AND TERMS:\nI paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept\n$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of \npatches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the \noriginal Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual.\n\nPrice:    Asking $650.00 (everything)\nShipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCraig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systems\ne-mail:  craigv@rad.verbex.com                            119 Russell Street\nphone: (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

A month ago I made a deal with him over the\nnet.  I was to sell him some memory, in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu.\nI thought the deal was great, so I went on with it.  \n\nI sent him the memory COD FOR $100.  He was then suppose to send me the cpu.\nI receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent the\ncpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU.\n\nI send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or\nwhat address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.)\nHe never reply my mail.  \n\nI finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't get\nthrought, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply.\nI call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he had\nsend out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it\nto.  \n\nHe said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day.\nTo my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, he\nnever reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every\nof my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)\n\nNow:  I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone.  I am also still\n      emailing him, but he won't reply my mail.\n\nSo if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him.\nhe can be reach at:\n\t\t\tDana Weick\n\t\t\t4238 W Las Palmaritas\n\t\t\tPhoenix, AZ 85051\n    (602)925-6123 in the day time this is his business number.\n    (602)842-2145 in the evenings this is his home number.\n\n\nhis email address is:\n\t\t\tweick@master.lds-az.loral.com\n*******This is our deal\n\nFrom weick@master.lds-az.loral.com Wed Mar 17 20:09:20 1993\n\n>> \n>> 72-pin SIMMS aren't hot sellers, I pick them up on the upgrade market for\n>> $140-160 quite often.  Best I can do is the 486DX2/66 and $100.\n>> \n>> \n>\n>Ok you got a deal, I'll trade you 4 (72pins SIMMs) for an Intel 486DX2/66 AND\n>$100.  I need you address for shippment, I will ship it via COD and I 'll pay\n>shipping/handling.  When the Simms arrive, there will be a $100 charge on your\n>part.

Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge,\nbending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you\nplug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior to\nshipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real\nsympathetic! \n \nIf you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed, \nDON'T GUESS!\n\n\n********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:****************************\n\nI call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was \nbusy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an house\nwent by, Weick didn't called.  I called him again, and his phone was discon-\nnected.\n\nSince this post,  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA\nWEICK have ripped them off.

I am asking around $70 with shipping\nincluded.\n\nWinSong for Windows:\n\nComposer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one.\n\nIt's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move\nand copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition.\n\nIt's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder.\nUp to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward\nand stop.\n\nIt plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set,\nsaxophone, clarinet, organ, and many.\n\nYou do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual\nis handy. For musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and\nstifling aspect.\n\nAlmost NEW (one week OLD), unregistered\n$70 (including shipping) OBO (please be reasonable)",
