Mario Lemieux is the explanation, IMHO.  \n\n>You could make a case that the *expectation* of an improving team that\n>would make the playoffs is the reason. \n\nFunny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.\n\n>But I think the reason is Lemieux\n>had a 168 point season and was the first non-Gretzky to win the Hart and\n>Ross since 1980.  People turned out to watch him play. \n\nI will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. \nBut this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase \nwill last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking\none.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \n\n>Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87. \n\nOk.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. \n\n>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is \n>true.  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing\n>this (Coffey late in 1987) and before they even had a playoff bound team.\n>A doubling of attendance occured in 1984-85 from the previous year.  An\n>increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival\n>of Mario Lemieux is what did it. \n\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\namazing, I'll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we've got a *kick*\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\n\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\n>Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They\n>are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement\n>since Gretzky's first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going\n>to see Gretzky.  they certainly aren't going to see a winner, they haven't\n>GOT a winner.  They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than\n>they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.\n\nI don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \n\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\n\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \n\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\nmake people around them better.\n\n>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)\n\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\n\n>This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't\n\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>\n\n>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge\n>jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.\n>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because\n>they are winning.\n\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\nSelanne.\n\nI did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the \nCFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If \nthat's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious\nto hear your explanation.",

He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but\nhe's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he\nwere more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away\nthat huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest\ndisappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's\nonly a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though\nnot through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided \nto threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the\naward goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be\nMVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the\nleague's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the \nrest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer\ngoals than Hartford.

According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver\ndollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the\nanniversary of the Stanley Cup.

My question is, since the loon is the only\ndollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative\ncoin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of\nthing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no\nchance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's\nthe current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the\ncrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-\nistically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they\nstill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is \nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \nexamples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\n\n>>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is \n>>true.

However, I'd suggest Kelly\nBuchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for\nthe All-Star game notwithstanding.\n\nAs for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations\nthis year due to his \"breakthrough\" year (for him) last year, so he didn't\nreally raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the\ncallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the\ndepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on\nthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent\nnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league\noblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.\nI think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.\n\nAs for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers\ndumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or\neven Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.\n\n-- \nAndrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com\nHP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253\n\nDuring the Roman Era, 28 was considered old...",

It turns out that the mask is\ncustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a\npiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face\nand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic\nwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a\nplaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12\nminutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the\ngoalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves\npadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  \nJohn Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. \n\n>He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a\n>new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current\n>mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was \n>*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two\n>fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed\n>back-ground.\n\nYeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.\n \n>The best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.\n>It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking \n>black panther on the forehead -- it *has* to be a new mask for Felix\n>Potvin, but he never said whose it was.\n\nActually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.

        "content": "Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter\nof what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\n\nCanadians: 400\nAmericans: 100\nEuropeans: 100\n\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\n25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.\n\n   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick\nof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the\nRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \"Bure\" \"Konstantinov\" and\n\"Borshevshky\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,\nand Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other\nteams is getting worse as well. \n\n    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \"Pavel Bure, the\nRussian Rocket\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \n\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even\nbetter hockey players. It's all hype. This \"European mystique\" is sickening,\nbut until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue\nto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.\n\n    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly\nonly getting worse.\n\n    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures\nand Selannes of the world play on their own continent.\n\n    I just don't want them on mine.\n\n\n \n \n-- \nRichard J.

If anything he's a surprise.\n\nMy choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players,\nbut I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie.

I thought that he was going to be the perfect\ncoach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO\nhas cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year.

        "content": "The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum\nSunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0\nshutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\nmounting any serious attack.\n\nInjuries:\n\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\n\nRoster Moves:\n\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\nold, 6'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\nup front as well.\n\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\n\nLines:\n\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nActon-Brown\n\nGalley-McGill\nYushkevich-Cronin\nCarkner-Hawgood\nBowen\n\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\n\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\n\nGame Summary:\n\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\n\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\nof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\n\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\naway every rebound.\n\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\n\nThe Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\n\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\n\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\ntripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\nBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\n\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\n\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\n\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\nlittle.\n\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\nperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\n\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\n\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\nequal and preserved the shutout.\n\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\nhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\n\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\n\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\nthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't\nremember that he's tied with.\n\nNext up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\nin Washington would be the official end.\n\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\nthan 5 under in 80).\n\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\ngoal for the team to focus on.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t38 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tEric Lindros\t67 1992-93\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tMark Recchi\t117 1992-93\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t51 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t117\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t79\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t58\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t58\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner",

Dreadful.\n\n>Also, why did Poulin get four minutes?\n\n\nI've been watching & playing hockey for a good long time now, and\nI've seen players with questionable tactics, but never have I seen\nwhat Ray did on Sunday. This guy gets my all time loser award. It's\none thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck\nwhen they are down, it's another thing to have a fist fight with\nsomeones balls.

I can see the relationship between free\nthrows awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's\nobviously easier to score in basketball, there are more\nopportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's\nat least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken\nby each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is\nprobably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe\n5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other\npenalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a\npenalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was\ninterfered with.\n\nAlso, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA\ngame you attended was, that play was stopped too often.\nWouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a\nhockey game?\n\nMatt att UVA",

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\n\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\nright side.\n\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\nto make a number of starts in a row.\n\n-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)\n-steveg@cadkey.com",

They give their\ngeneral managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best\nplayers so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is\nin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him\nto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.\n\nWhere do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian\nplayers.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners\ncan do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable\nhere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US\nthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their\nimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.\n\nIncreasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would\nmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the\nlower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some\nthat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm\nclub, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on\nthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian\nplayers in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))\nSo with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players\nin North America.\n\n>\n>    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly\n>only getting worse.\n>\n>    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures\n>and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.\n>\n>    I just don't want them on mine.\n\nI'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the\nworld.

The National Hockey League should love the idea, though.\n>Pan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the\n>American networks likely never will pay.\n\nThis brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned\nthat the NHL could expand in Europe.\n\nWould most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing\nto play for a team in Europe?\n\nI do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily\ninterested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.\n(I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)\n\nWhen one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes\nme wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:\n\n- Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons)\n- Nicholls ... in Edmonton.\n- R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only.\n- C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.\n\nI know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:\n\n- Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french\n  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One\n  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could\n  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.\n\nAnybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved\nto London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league\n(2 years ago?)\n\nI wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.\n\nMyself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be \nthe best way to do it? \n\nMarc",

Evans\") writes:\n: \n: Of course, penalties will have to be changed:\n: \n: Roughing:\tChauvanistic Males Being Aggressive\n: Slashing:\tChauvanistic Males Venting Frustration\n: Fighting:\tProof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings\n: \n\nNO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should\nonly be three penalties:\n\n1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\n\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\n\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\n\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\n\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\nthe PA announcer says it.\n\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \nchance of pronouncing his name right.\n\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\n\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\nit truly is a sad day.\n\nEnough for now.\n\ndvb",

All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except \nmatchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3-\n2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season \npoints will choose whether to start the series at home or away.\n\n-----\n\n- Draft news:\n\n        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in \nJune, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one \ngoaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion \ndrafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction \nbetween forwards and defensemen.\n        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down \nfrom the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and \nOttawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.\n        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of \none goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is \nthat a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.\n        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises \nwill have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total \nof 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \nnew teams.\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \n1994.\n\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \n1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a \ndelay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.\n\n-----\n \n- League news:\n\nDisputes:\n\n  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary \narbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

        "content": "After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as\npossible), I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots\nthis year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other\ngoaltenders). I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just\nas examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the\nhead, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens\n(Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of\ncourse he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match\npenalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few\nyears ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in\nmy mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also\nvery good.\n\nHow about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that\ngoes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore.\n\nOh, the playoffs should be fun,\nRalph",

        "content": "Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. \nThe Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\n\n\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot \ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\n\n\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a\ndefenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\nreally trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \ngood fight once in a while, but only when it's \"called for\".  You know, when a\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \nI'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\nreferee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.\n\nJust My Honest Opinion,\n\nGary at Hofstra\nACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU\nACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET",

It is Mats Sundin and\n Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late\n stage of the tournament.

Dammit,\neven Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs\na power forward with some talent, IMO.\n\nThen watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say\nwhat you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. \nAnd Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. \nLast night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came\non the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he\ndidn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.

CANADIENS IN 7.\n\nAgreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or\ndoes everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!\n\nFinal\n>Boston vs. Montreal:\n>Will Bruin domination continue in this rivalry? Yes. Moog has\n>consistently outperformed Roy in the playoffs (after 1986)..[other stuff]\n> Bruins in five.\n\nI can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for\n6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play\nin the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't\nbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will\nnot be putting money on this series. :-)\n\n>Patrick Division, semifinal\n\n>Pittsburgh vs. NY Islanders:\n>What can I say? The Pens are flying high and have the most talent in\n>the league. \n\nAgreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent\nof the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is\ncredit to NY.\n\n>Washington vs. New Jersey:\n>CAPITALS IN 5.\n\nAgreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent\nteam, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.\n\n>Pittsburgh vs. Washington:\n>If the Caps had Bill Ranford I might see an upset, but Don Beaupre\n>just doesn't inspire my hopes.  PENGUINS IN 6.\n\nI think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't\nthink it will go six either...*maybe* five.\n\n>CONFERENCE FINAL:\n>Pittsburgh vs. Boston:\n>A replay of last year. The Penguins are just as good as 12 months ago,\n>and the Bruins are much improved. But... PENGUINS IN 6.\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They\nown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once\nagain I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\n\n>Campbell Conference, Norris Division, semifinal\n\n>Chicago vs. St. Louis (or Minnesota):\n> BLACKHAWKS IN 5.\n\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,\nIMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.\n\n>Detroit vs. Toronto:\n>The Leafs have had an excellent season, but they've been playing\n>playoff hockey all year - the Habs under Burns were the same way and\n>always wilted in the playoffs.  RED WINGS IN 5.\n\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\n\n>FINAL:\n>Chicago vs. Detroit:\n> This will be a war. Fedorov will win it in OT. RED WINGS IN 7.\n\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\n\n>Smythe Division SEMI-FINALS:\n\n>Vancouver vs. Winnipeg:\n> CANUCKS IN 7.\n\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\n\n>Calgary vs. Los Angeles:\n>This would have been tough to call, except for three things. 1/ The\n>Kings don't have a goalie; 2/ Gary Roberts will be back; 3/ the Kings\n>shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner (Paul Coffey)\n>for a proven loser (Jimmy Carson). Gretzky is just too weary to carry\n>this group. FLAMES IN 5.\n\nThis is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. \nI don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a\nnon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate\nGretzky.  LA in six.\n\n>FINAL:\n>Vancouver vs. Calgary:\n> FLAMES IN 6.\n\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be\nLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.\n\n>COFERENCE FINAL:\n>Detroit vs. Calgary:\n> RED WINGS IN 7.\n\nWow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked\nLA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.\n\n>STANLEY CUP FINAL:\n>Pittsburgh vs. Detroit:\n>Three in a row and official 'dynasty' status for the Pens? Or can the\n>Wings complete a dream season? Well, the Wings are better in goal (not\n>sufficiently so though IMHO) and have better D-men. However, Mario and\n>the boys can sure score. Look for Jagr to shine in the playoffs,\n>though I sure would love to see Probert beat some sense into him. The\n>Pens are just too much, especially since Detroit will have a tougher\n>battle to get here. PENGUINS IN 5.\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet\nagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\nbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\nthough, I'd have to take the Penguins.\n\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\nall-round players in the NHL.\n\n\n\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca",

But that is\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\nrather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm\n\n-- \nRoger Maynard \nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca",

Since Hartford is pitiful, the\nIslanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most\nlikely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor\nshooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit\nthe broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of\nit.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?  I don't know if that would\nhelp, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some\nlight on the subject.\n\nAnd, my playoff pool is running!!!

        "subject": "FLYERS notes 4/17",
        "content": "The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,\na 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing\nthe future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time\nalmost bearable.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 34 assists, 75 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t40 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tEric Lindros\t75 1992-93\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n53 goals, 70 assists, 123 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tMark Recchi\t123 1992-93*\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t53 1992-93*\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t123\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t86\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t62\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t59\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner",

The ruling in\nCohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision\nin the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial\nLawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest\nlaw firm representing the women athletes.\n   \"This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a\nschool wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of\nopportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,\"\nsaid TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.\n   The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that\nprohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions\nreceiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as\nuniversity-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to\ncompete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for\nuniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also\nbeen denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.\n   \"This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,\"\nsaid TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &\nLabinger.  \"Universities across America need to reevaluate their\nprograms quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced.\"\n   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State\nUniversity, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and Colgate\nUniversity are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders\nrequiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity\nteams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is\nrepresenting women athletes at IUP.\n   In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included:\nRay Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca\n& Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  The\nNational Women's Law Center, Women's Sports Foundation, and National\nAssociation for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in\nsupport of TLPJ's appeal.\n -30-",

The puck clearly hit the crossbar\nand then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,\nkept harping about how they \"must have had a different view upstairs\"\nbecause it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who\nsaw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally \nsignalled no goal but the video replay \"judges\" initiated contact with\nthe referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is\nunheard of.  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about\nthe Leaf chances this year.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm\n\n-- \nRoger Maynard \nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca",

It is much easier to be an element of change\n\nHardly.  The \"established\" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.\nThe  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team\ncould successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did\nwas formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-\nolistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-\ner  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly\ndebatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-\nbate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people\nplayed hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe\nand his pals showed up.\n\n>or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates\n>a new situation.  If you want to honor players like Bobby Orr than I'm sure\n>you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive \n>defenseman.\n\nWhat's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better\ndefenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that\nBruce Norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby\nOrr's  then,  in the interests of education, why don't you take a poll\nand find out how many people know who Norris was?  But you don't  have\nto, do you?\n\n>No I can't for the reasons I gave above.

Quoting me out of context does\nmore to erode your credibility than it  does  mine.   My  position  is\nclearly  progressive  and  is anything but \"biased, closed minded, ig-\nnorant\".  Arrogant, I will grant you.\n\n>arrogant, and moronic as you.

Best \nstrategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.\nTaylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,\nwhen the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell\nand will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.\n\n     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; \nwhat's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).\n\nOthers can add on their opinions as well.\n\nKevin L.

        "content": "The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period\nand the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium.\nBrendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17\nseconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\n\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\n10-9 in the first period.\n\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\n\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\n\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\ndeflected the puck in the net.\n\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\n\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\n\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\nangle.\n\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\n\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\nin the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on\non four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in\nthe league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.\n \nThe game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an\nAll-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when\nCBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday\nin St. Louis.\n\nBox score\n---------\nBlues 4, Blackhawks 3\n\nBLUES       0    2    2   --   4\nCHICAGO     1    2    0   --   3\n\nFIRST PERIOD\n\n   CHI -- Noonan 1 (Larmer, K.Brown), 8:17.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (holding), 2:28; Zombo, StL (interference), 6:00;\nMurphy, Chi (high-sticking), 11:30; Grimson, Chi (boarding), 14:39; Zombo, StL\n(holding), 18:46.\n\nSECOND PERIOD\n\n   STL -- Brown 1 (Shanahan, Emerson), 3:12.\n   CHI -- (PPG) Noonan 2 (Roenick, Chelios), 5:40.\n   CHI -- Noonan 3 (Matteau, Sutter), 8:51.\n   STL -- Felsner 1 (McRae, Janney), 12:49.\n\n   Penalties -- Baron, StL (interference), 4:33; Wilson, StL (tripping), 9:31.\n\nTHIRD PERIOD\n\n   STL -- (PPG) Shanahan 1 (J.Brown, Hull), 11:12.\n   STL -- (PPG) Hull 1 (Emerson, J.Brown), 11:29.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (roughing), 1:54; Matteau, Chi (high-sticking),\n9:56; Smith, Chi (slashing), 10:49; Baron, StL (roughing), 14:23.\n\nSHOTS ON GOAL\n\nBLUES       10    10     7   --   27\nCHICAGO      9     5    13   --   27\n\nPower-play Opportunities -- St. Louis 2 of 4; Chicago 1 of 7.\n\nGoaltenders -- St. Louis, Joseph, 1-0-0 (27 shots-24 saves).\n               Chicago, Belfour, 0-1-0 (27-23).\n\nReferee -- Kerry Fraser.

Any other \n\nThe Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach\nera, when Darryl Sittler was called a \"cancer on the team\", he tore the\nC off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.\n\nSittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly\ncaptaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead,\nSittler got traded to Detroit.\n\nRick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and\nthey took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.\n\nDuring Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss\nthe  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad\nMarsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried\nto give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.\n\nThe best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late\nof the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably\none of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of\nplaying coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be-\ncame the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a\ncaptain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the\nplayers.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making\nsure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.\n\n\n-- \n\ncordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \n                                           \"So many morons...\nrm                                                   ...and so little time.\"",

Can't believe people actually put\n>win as first in a tie breaker......\n\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\nwin.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\nthat's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\nhad the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,\nmaybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.\n:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller\t\t\t\tLET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\t\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!\n\n            \"When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you.\"",

For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially\nimpressive. \n\nThe games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and\nnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,\nhits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren\nRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed\nto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think\nVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,\nas Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King\ninserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's\ngame.

The goalie\nwho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series\nfor his team.\n\nEposode Summary\n---------------\nThis episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that\nhe bought from the concession stand.\n\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\nof me. Beauty.\"\n\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\nthe arenas in the NHL.\n\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\n\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\nand the AHL championships.\n\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\nwent cold.\n\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\nbe a 'country club'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves... If\nthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the\nyardarm by their thumbs.\"\n\n\nRating\n------\nNothing too special in this episode.\n\nI'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \\  \\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\n    \\  \\                  |Department of Computing Science,\n     \\  \\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n      \\    ###  \\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\n       \\___###___\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were\na pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked\nunlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for\nthe Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would\nhave been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon\nof the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can\nmaintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.\n\nIn the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-\nway too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.\nHe fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and\nQuinn in my estimation.\n\nI can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen\nin hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.\n\nGregmeister",

YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one\nof the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!).

Come on,\nJoe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.\nWhy they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams\nis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two\ngoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good\nteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\nof comparing two goaltenders.\n\n> > The fact of the matter is that, despite last nights shutout, he doesn't\n> > have what it takes.

Does that make Soderstrom's shutouts less impressive because of\n> Toronto's lack of offense?\n\nYES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\ndoesn't have a game like that in him.\n\n> Well if you look back to November when Roussel was the #1 goalie (Soderstrom\n> was being treated for his heart ailment).

FLYERS management never says bad thing about\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen\nat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was\nto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,\nDom has played well too.\n\n> By the way, what was the final card on Monday night?

        "content": "Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have\naffected the AHL this year.\n\n\nST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS\nThe St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by\nproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\nwill return to St John's once the strike ends.\n===================================================\nSENATORS SOLD\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \n\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\n==================================================\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n============================================================\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n=========================================================\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\n======================================================\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\nSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\n=====================================================\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\n=====================================================\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\n\nONE OPTION\t\t\t\tANOTHER OPTION\n\t\t\t\nNorthern Division\t\t\tSouthern Division\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\t\t\tADIRONDACK\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\t\t\tSPRINGFIELD\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\t\t\tPROVIDENCE\nCD ISLANDERS\t\t\t\tCDI\nPORTLAND PIRATES\t\t\tHERSHEY\n\t\t\t\t\tBINGHAMTON\nSouthern Division\t\t\tROCHESTER\nHERSHEY BEARS\t\t\t\tHAMILTON\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\t\t\tUTICA\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\t\t\tAtlantic Division\nUTICA (?)

        "subject": "SHARKS REVIEW Part 1: Goaltenders",
        "content": "As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,\ntrying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through\nfor the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\nkill them.\n\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\n\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\n\n#1\tBRIAN HAYWARD\t\tSeason:\t11th\nAcquired:\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tP (D)\n\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\n\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\n\n#30\tJEFF HACKETT\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tC\n\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\nyear.\n\n#31\tWADE FLAHERTY\t\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\nAcquired:\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\nGrade:\t\tI (A-)\n\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\nmay not ever.\n\n#32\tARTURS IRBE\t\tSeason:\t1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\n\n  35.

After a \n> couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the \n> Nordic  (presuming that our teams would have the advantage in  drafting \n> local talent, as prooposed).\n\nThat's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &\nAmerican Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our\nset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\n---\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\n\n(28-30=superstar)\n(23-27=star)\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\n(13-17=NHL regular)\n( 8-12=role player)\n\nFINLAND:  \n\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\n\nC-Jari Kurri........25\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\n\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\n\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\n(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\n\nSWEDEN:\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\nD-Calle Johansson...18\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\n\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\nC-Thomas Steen......18\n\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\nR-Michael Nylander..13\n\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\nL-Jan Erixon........14\n\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\n---\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\nisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\nwon't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \ncouple of years the same way Edmonton's \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late '80s. \nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a \ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \n\n> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>  J O O   J O O   J O K E R I T  !  !  !

There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radio\nbroadcast team.  \n\nNo word on who the announcers will be.

ESPN had\nprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had\ncontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal\nwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this\none-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the\nseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by\nsqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota\ngame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball\ntelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last\nnight).\n\nBut the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They\nmust honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something\nto do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of\ncontract with baseball.\n\nSo relax.  I'm happy.

        "content": "1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports.\n-------------------------------------------------\nKings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93\n\nThe third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against\nthe second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of\na non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.\n\nSymthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\ntries.\n\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\n\n1st period: \n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\nin 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\n\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\nthe period.\n\n2nd period: \nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\n\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\n\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\n\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\n\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\n\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\n\n3rd period:\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\n\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\n\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\n\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\n\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \n8:19) took penalties.  \n\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\n\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\n\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\nright out of the game.\n\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\npenalty killing.\n\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\n\nNotes:\n------\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\n\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\n\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\n\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \ngames.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play\nover their last 9 games.\n\nThe teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.\n\nPlayoffs:\nCampbell Conference:\nSmythe Division:\nLA  6  @ CAL 3 \t\tLA leads 1-0\nWIN    @ VAN\n\nNorris Division:\nSTL 4  @ CHI 3\t\tSTL leads 1-0\nTOR    @ DET\n\nWales Conference:\nAdams Division:\nBUF 5  @ BOS 4 (OT)\tBUF leads 1-0\nMON 2  @ QUE 3 (OT)\tQUE leads 1-0\n\nPatrick Division:\nNJ  3  @ PIT 6\t\tPIT leads 1-0\nNYI 1  @ WAS 3\t\tWAS leads 1-0\n\nRecords:\n--------\nvs\tSmythe\t Norris\t Patrck\tAdams\tOverall\n================================================\nHome:    0- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    0- 0-0 \nRoad:    1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    1- 0-0\n==============================================================\nTotal:   1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0\t0-0-0\t 1- 0-0  \n\nBox Score:\n=========================\nCalgary      0 1 2 - 3\nLos Angeles  1 3 2 - 6\n=========================\n\n1st period: \nLA  Sydor 1 (Gretzky, Sandstrom), 0:16\n    LA  Millen - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Fleury - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Skrudland - interference, 12:25\n    LA  Carson - tripping 14:53\n    CAL Dahlquist - holding stick, 18:34\n    CAL Dahl - roughing 19:30\n\n2nd period: \n    CAL Verson - delay of game (served by Ashton), 1:34\nCAL Suter 1 (Fleury), 2:48 (sh)\nLA  Carson 1 (Shuchuk, Sydor), 3:13 (pp)\nLA  Huddy 1 (Taylor, Rychel), 3:37\nLA  McSorley 1 (unassisted), 6:36\n    CAL Skrudland - elbowing, 10:53\n    LA  Sydor - tripping, 12:35\n    LA  Watters- hooking, 14:40\n    LA  McSorley - holding, 17:19\n    CAL Suter - high sticking, 17:31\n    LA  Sandstrom - hooking, 18:03\n\n3rd period:\nLA  Millen 1 (Granato, Donnelly), 1:06\n    LA Sydor - hooking, 1:24\n    CAL Nieuwendyk - tripping, 3:22\nCAL Dahlquist 1 (Otto), 4:23\n    CAL Fleury - major (boarding), game misconduct, 6:08\n    LA  Granato - tripping, 6:44\n    LA  Watters - interference, 8:19\nCAL Yawney 1 (MacInnis, Reichel), 8:47\n    CAL MacInnis - roughing, 9:56\nLA  Carson 2 (Sandstrom, Robitaille), 10:32 (pp)\n    LA  Hardy - holding, 11:38\n    CAL Skrudland - slashing, 16:17\n    CAL Stern - double roughing, cross-checking, 10 min. misconduct, 16:17\n\nOvertime: none\n\nShots:\n------\nLos Angeles   8  9 14 - 31\nCalgary       5  8 11 - 24\n\nPower play conversions:\n-----------------------\nFor:      2 of 10; for the year:  2 of  10,  20.00%\nAgainst:  0 of  8; for the year:  8 of   8, 100.00%\n\nGoalies:\n--------\nLos Angeles - Hrudey (1-0-0)\nCalgary - Vernon (0-1-0)\n\nAttendance: 18,605\n\nScratches:\n----------\nRob Blake - back contusion\nGuy Leveque - numbers\nLonnie Loach - numbers\nMarc Potvin - numbers\nBrandy Semchuk - numbers\nRobb Stauber - numbers\nBrent Thompson - numbers\nJim Thomson - numbers\n\nLines - Forwards:\n----------------\n*Robitaille - Gretzky - Sandstrom \nDonnelly - Millen - Kurri\nRychel - Conacher - Taylor\nGranato - Carson - Shuchuk\n\nLines - Defense:\n----------------\n*Huddy - Sydor\nWatters - Zhitnik\nHardy - McSorley\n\n* denotes starting lineup\n\nNext game:\n----------\nWednesday, April 21 @ Calgary Flames; 6:30pm Pacific Time on Prime Ticket\n===============================================================================\nStan Willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com)\nnet contact: L.A.

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that\ngoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're\nMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;\nhe literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an\nexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\ngoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,\nStewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.\n\nMontreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\ntraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \nNormally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \nfive, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \nESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't\nthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \nthe zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to \nplay.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\n\nDemers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let\nthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this\narticle, if possible.\n\n>Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal.

I haven't seen a\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \nArmy.  \n\nBut I still hate the team.\n\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a\npowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. \nSame goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.

Trading Adam Oates\nfor Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a \ngreat player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly\nto the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by \ninjury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back\nproblems from which he never really recovered).\n\nPut Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the \nleague behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.\n\n--Randy",

If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will\nre-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.\n\n#8\tLARRY DEPALMA\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Minnesota\nGrade:\t\tI (C-/D+)\n\nNo netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at\nthe end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he\nwasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on\nthe waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n\t\tpick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:\t\tA/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:\t\tI (B-/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

He works\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\nto make the team next year.\n\n#3\tDAVID WILLIAMS\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\nGrade:\t\tC/C-\n\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\n'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\nplaymaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\n\n#4\tJAYSON MORE\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nAfter being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp\nbefore '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\n\n#5\tNEIL WILKINSON\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB-\n\nWilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\n\n#6\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (A)\n\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\nbut he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\n\n#19\tDOUG ZMOLEK\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB\n\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\n(Applause.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.\n(Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)\n\n                             * * * * * *\n\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\nthis morning, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\ntalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and\ntalk some more.\n\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\ncompromise is no compromise.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.\nWe'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good\nabout it.\n\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\n\n                                 END       10:10 A.M.

You're not good at math. But bear\nwith me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as \ngetting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd\nhave two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also\nhave two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are\ndifferent.\n\nPerhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again.

If he was as great a GM as you claim\n\nI think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great\nGM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you\ngave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue\nback and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-\nthat is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better \nthan yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original\npost (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not\nthe coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:\n\n>and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\n>enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\n\nI think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here\nwhich transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for \nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\nimprove as a result.\n\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how\ngood of a GM he really is.\n\n>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\n>so none of this is true anyway.\n\nI may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing\nit with you.\n\n>Gregmeister\n\n--Randy",

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that\nwould *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. \nHextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...\nBoth Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because\nhis gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head \nfor the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from \nend-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by \nYoung in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall \nfor most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero \nbecause Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.\n\nHextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very \nwell, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over \nBellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all \nthose opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.\nHextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... \n\n>Blaming Stewart is just an\n>excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\n>goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.\n\nSure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against\nan explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with\na powerplay that was totally unnecessary.\n\n>Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\n>traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \n\nI disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night. \nThe defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,\nNolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.\n\n>Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \n>five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \n>ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.

Leclair missed his opportunities,\nas did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\nwere *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night.

They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should\nthey read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \"Burnsian\" hockey to shut\ndown Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the \nextra 2.\n\nRed Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the\nseries 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ?\nThe fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.\n\n>I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.

But the goal itself was a great piece of work\nby Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the\npuck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\n\nYaska  ! yaska@eecg.toronto.edu !

The idea was that youngsters could\nplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these\nolder guys did not. \nAnd they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he\nwasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic\nin thinking they could make up for his contributions.\nAn example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\nbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent\ncontributor worth keeping around.\n\nThe youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who\nmight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But\nyou have to find the right balance.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSteve Cole  (steve@sep.stanford.edu, apple!sep!steve)\nDepartment of Geophysics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305",

        "content": "To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:\n\n  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people \nin the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. \nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \nwhich may happen.\n\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't \nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see \nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\tSo, Minnesota may end up \ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\n\n\t\n\tGo Sabres!\n\t\n\tRobert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)\n\trandolin@polisci.umn.edu",

Smith\ncame out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the\nback of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what\nhappened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never\nhad a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan\nof Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. \n\nIt was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie\nat the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting\nin pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of \ntheir own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the \ngoaltender, or whatever.\n\nAnd to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only\nsay that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.\nThere was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late\nin the third period of the 7th game of the second round.

        "subject": "Blues into playoffs, beat TB 6-5",
        "content": "By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\n\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\n\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\nWith the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.\n\n``It wasn't pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but\nit did.\"\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It's a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that's all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\n\nSome players didn't have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\" said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.\n\n``I didn't know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,\nand that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend.\"\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\"\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he's happy.\"\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"\n\n  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*\n  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % \n  %   \\ \\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * \n  *    \\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % \n  %     \\    ________/                                                   *\n  *      \\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % \n  %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *\n  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % \n  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * \n  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%",

So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in\n\n\n\nfluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.\n\nPersonally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced \"European\" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on.\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         \nI stand by all the misstatements that I've made.\n\t\t-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89\n\nMe Too -- Nick Duncan <duncan@mprgate.mpr.ca>",

If you check the THN stats for\nKansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the\n4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM).

He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\nmotivated.

His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\nretirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\nnow is the Gulls.\n\n>#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\n>Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\n>Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\n>I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n>14 games he played this season.\n\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\nfairly lost on the ice.

Too bad that we couldn't get it\non ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.\n\nMike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne.\nMike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.\n\ngld\n--\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGary L.

I mean, it was the\nFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous\npenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \"delay of game\"\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3\nskating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans\nwere starting to come up strong.\nI am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.\nIf you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not\nable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to\nadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most\nother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the\nOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish\nspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see\nall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best\nteam/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team\nlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to\nadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team\nto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).\nBut, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as\nthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)\nGermans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all\nultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a\ngreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience\nmost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as\na big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we\njust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers\ncorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all\nAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging\naround beeing drunk on ferries...). \nIn my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you\ndon't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\"There's no time to hate, barely time to wait\" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter)",

        "content": "1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.\n--------------------------------\nPlayoffs:\n---------\n*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme\nby Rick Sadowski, Daily News\n\nBarry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the\ncrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with\nthe rookie goaltender.\n\n\"I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most\nfun time of the year, and I'm not,\"  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  \"I\nthink I have worked hard enough for that.\"\n\nStauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie\nin their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\n6-3 opening victory.\n\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\n\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.\n\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\nSaddledome popcorn.\n\n\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I'd be\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\nplayoffs.\"\n\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\n\nWhile insisting he is the Kings' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \nVancouver on Thursday.\n\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\ngreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\"\n\n\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\nmore from him than he does.\"\n\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\n\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\n\n\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry \ndoesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm\na perfectionist.\"\n\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \neven though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's \na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \nyou're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain \nto him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I \ndo know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\"\n\nMelrose's \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \"Before\nyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\n\n------\n\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \nChannel 7 here in LA.  The Kings averaged a 2.1 Nielsen rating in the 10 regular\nseason games aired on Channel 5.\n\nAround the NHL:\n---------------\n*San Jose fired Coach George Kingston, who lead the team to a 11-71-2 mark in \ntheir 2nd NHL season.  Kingston was 28-129-7 over the past 2 years with the\nSharks.\n\n------\n\n*Former Islander executive Bill Torrey was named as President of the expansion\nFlorida Panthers.  Bobby Clarke was named as the clubs General Manager.\n\n*Last nights games:\n-------------------\nWIN  2 @ VAN  4 (VAN leads 1-0)\nTOR  3 @ DET  6 (DET leads 1-0)\n\n===============================================================================\nStan Willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com)\nnet contact: L.A.

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\n on the 1-3 goal.\n\n Lines information follows further below.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\n Attendance: 3,500\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Group B results:\n\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\n\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\n Attendance: 10,200\n\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\n\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\n Attendance: 2,800\n\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\n whole game).

Too bad nobody is in front\nmost of the time.\n\nDo you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique\ngets knocked down?  It's disgusting.  We also have Lebeau (5'10\", 172)\ngetting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6'3\", 205) with no reply\nfrom the team, except to yell for a penalty.  Dammit, Denis Savard \nthrew the best (only?)

The third \nperiod at least provided something to look forward to.  Habs won the\nperiod, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a\ncouple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game\nhad started at 7:30.  Hopefully they play that way at home.  Roy made \nthe saves (we'll ignore that second goal), so now it's up to the team.\n\n\n--\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca\n\n\nP.S.

A low GAA against good\n> teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\n> of comparing two goaltenders.\n\nLet's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n> The same\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\ntickets next season:-).\n\n                                         \\ \\\nJoe Dakes                                 \\/\\\nAT&T Microelectronics                      \\/\\\n555 Union Boulevard                         \\ \\\nAllentown, PA  18103                     LET'S GO FLYERS! \nalux1!jmd                                     \\ \\\njmd@aluxpo.att.com                             \\ \\__________\n                                                \\____/_//__/",

From a farm out\n|> in Boondock, Saskatchewan or Weedville, Alberta.\n|> \n\nThe biggest advantage that kids from Boondock or Weedville have is the\navailability of ice.  In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000\nand that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,\nBritish Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There\nare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here\nit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid\nwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say \"what does he know? He's from\nCalifornia.\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,\na town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was\non skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational\nhockey for about 35 years.\n\n|> >When was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city.\n|> >The insurance alone is a big enough barrier.\n|> \n|> The inner city isn't the only place that is poor.\n|> I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.\n\n\nLack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\n\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an\nindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther\nKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown\n(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west\nof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.\nDublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive\nto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice\ntime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them\ngive you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and\ninclude the resurfacing time in the fee.\n\n\n-- \nAlan Hepburn           \"A man doesn't know what he knows\nNational Semiconductor       until he knows what he doesn't know.\"\nSanta Clara, Ca              \nalan@berlioz.nsc.com                              Thomas Carlyle",

I never, ever thought that anyone\nwould argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\nplay.\n\nIn my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\n\n(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.

        "content": "It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of\nnightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  \n   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three\ngames of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a\nbest of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this\ntime.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.\n   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice\nadvantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It\nwasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.\n   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting\ngoaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.\nBuffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on\nthe powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.\nLaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was\nKhmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres\nstole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and\nHannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a\nshot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob\nSweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of\npenalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get\nhis first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes\nlater, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied\nthe game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.\nLast year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet\nrevenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a\ntip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.\nBoth teams finished with 34 shots.  \n        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.\n        Referee--Rob Shick.\n\nComments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of\nclutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic\nagain.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead\nflung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea\nto Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever\nheard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was\nonly five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no\none took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,\nnoted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was\ntoo loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as\nmost of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev\ndidn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't\nskate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each\nwere out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in\nan interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he\nresponed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than\nthat, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The\ninterviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he\nmust not understand playoffs.

Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost\nGrillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep\nthose three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston, which, of course, is now\na moot point). \n\nThe Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly\nconsensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There\nwere conflicts. Ferriera lost. That says nothing about his skills or\naccomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics. \n\nI think he did some good things for the Sharks, but that he never fit in as\na \"Shark person\".

Jagr,\nMacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one\nelement of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.\n\nDespite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing\nadantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and\nkeep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens\nbottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to\nconfigure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new\nlooks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.\n\nBowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an\nindividual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed\nof Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As\na result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played\nalmost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern\nscored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.\nHis ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is\ncommendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might\nsimply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about\nsuccess.\n\nWhile no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson,\nBowman, in his own way, has made himself a permanent, though not clearly\nseen, mark in  Pittsburgh.",

In general, you\nshould expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,\nthere is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain\nand discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another\nplayer. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That\ntwo hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of\nrespect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He\ndid not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the\nslot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he\nslashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a\nLeaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I\nwas very disappointed.\n\nYou're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least\nin his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and\nfor that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's\nwhy their names always comes up as examples when we talk about\nthese issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd\nhate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like\nhim very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but\nintentional) use of the stick.\n\nGary",

He just wasn't\ndiagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to\nhave some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he'd just been\nput on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.

He might see a movie about\nsomething and automatically assume the situation is the same for his\nown life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes,\nbut still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD\nepisode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt\nit slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).

If\nlast night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole\nchampionship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is\nto pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the\nlast period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury\nsuffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for\nthe playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an \nItalian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game\nagainst the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third\nperiod goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game\nwinner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity\nfor years, but perhaps its BACK!

The\nrest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason\nthey got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the\ncoaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort\npossible out of his team.

The\nSabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in\nthe opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in\nsuch ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres\nwon a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game)\nwhen LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his\nshot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps\nover to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting\nit up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming,\n\"They score, THEY SCORE!!!\".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping\nup and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating\nover to Brad May who he jumped on.\n\nDoug McKee\nmckee@cs.buffalo.edu",

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a\nlot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.\nIt is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the\nsame team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally\ngood players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare\nbetween players on different teams.\n\nI agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful\nare the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is\na missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring\nthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a\nbetter stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice\ntime actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low\namounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who\ndoesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of\nquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that\nthinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than\n+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.\n\n+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.\nYou are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see\nthat being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed\nis a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.\n\nGregmeister",

While he's not\nexactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie's\nlegs (or something like that) in response to the Neely incident.  It\nwas quite amusing, as one of the few Letterman viewers who actually knew\nwhat he was talking about.  Anybody know who the Pens celebrity hockey\nplayer is?

I don't\nseem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too\nmuch, or failing to clear the zone.  He worked hard, and at\nleast didn't make any rookie mistakes.  As he said himself in an\ninterview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.  \n\n>\n>Ranger fans may be suffering but we're some of the most loyal, unlike Islander\n>fans who only show up when the team wins.\n>\n\nAbsolutely.

I don't\nlike it, but that's the way the league is going.\n\nBy the way, there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devil\ngame. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick.

Edmonton has been fairly\nsupportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market\nteam, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\nthat the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\nthan many teams in larger cities did.

We\nalso get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The\nGrapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach\nabout what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don\nisn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were\nDon got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the\nBoston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill\nme in on this info?\n  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday\nmorning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off\nsometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave\nhigh praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not\njust a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player\nin the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour\nis a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman\nabout a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?\n  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from\ncity to city.\n  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>\n              is the best two-way player in the league today.'\n \n  There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he\nbasically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.\n  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario\nLemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs\nfrom the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the\nWales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about\nLemieux.

And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16,\nthey will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this\nis still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but\nit is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.\n\n\nI asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was\nnot that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time\nwithout much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon\nis usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.\nShe told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf\nwas shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come\ncontractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She\nthen couldn't give me a coherent answer.\n\n\nAlso, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game\nattendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks\nshould begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with\n thier sports programming.\nI hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain\nbitterlyt about this.

What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays\nreally well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths\nis not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he\nallowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you\nshould get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third\nperiod.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they\nwould not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular\ngoalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they\nare occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like\nSakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there \nare any legitimate excuses. \n\n>Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces \n>[description of lucky bounces.....]\n>Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... \n\nI am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.

My main concern is the second \ngoal.\n\n>This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,\n>as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\n>were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave\n>up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\n\nWhat you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the \ngame was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you\ncould watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what\nif's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final\nresult is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and\nemail you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive\nscrewups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie\nis the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is\nfocussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*\ngoal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.\n\n>>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\n\n>And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. \n\nWHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally\nunrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if\nyou're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key\nsaves at the key times.\n\n>Roy is paid big money because\n>that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5\n\nFor the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in\nthe league.

They are no better than uninformed fans.\n                            \nI assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think\nthe loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've\nmade any other 'derogatory comments'.

And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN\nin favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between\nchannels every week.\n\nBut, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy?\n-- \nMike Eisler, mre@Eng.Sun.Com  ``Not only are they [Leafs] the best team, but\n their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburgh's.

North-ame-\nricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average\neuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better \nskater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL\nare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league\ngame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many \nbreakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in\nNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because\nof clumsy defensemen.\n\nI have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars\naren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans\nare in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the\nclass of his own). \n\nTommi",

There have been cheap shot artists\nthrough the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players.\nBobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been\nout right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed\nand players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players\nlike Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed\nto continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000\naluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get\na chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.\nThe sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a\nStanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers\nin the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not\neven notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey.\n\n\nRich",

Enough said?\n\nSo,even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who \nelse (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus, Harry the Horse trader comes\nout on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry, not\nin spite of him.\n\nBTW, do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet \nthey finish fourth or fifth in the Conference, behind any of the following:\nPittsburgh, Quebec, Boston, Washington, Islanders.  Someone correct me if\nthese five teams will not be in Montreal's conference.\n\nIn summary, things look bleak for the Habs, at least in the near future.

        "content": "4/23/93    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN, LEAD SERIES 3-0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIt was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and\nthe Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were\ncheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the\nentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning\nhours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis\nPost-Disptach. Enjoy...\n\nBy Dave Luecking\nOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:\n\nAt 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues\ngoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the\nthe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than\nJoseph.\"  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to\nthe verge of a surprising sweep.\n\nJoseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks\n3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0\nlead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nThe Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second\nperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,\na Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the\nfirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only\ntwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.\n\nThe Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,\na nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had\nonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept\nPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to\nmake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the\nBlackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.\n\nWell, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at \nevery opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues\nwere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.\n\nThe Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --\nwore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.\nThe grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and\nscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.\n\nCraig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each\nperiod. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise\nChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and\nrookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final \nperiod.\n\nBlues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling\n``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.\" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour \n``Bell-Four. Bell-Four.\" They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.\"\n\nSuch talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are\non a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.\n\nThe Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first\nminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan\ndumped Steve Smith at center ice.\n\nChicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph\nbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.\n\nThe Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a\nscare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to\nSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw\nat him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph\nabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly\nstyle is deadly.\n\nRookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the\nperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two\nshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the\npuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.\n \nMarouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.\nHe caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third\npenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,\nand gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu\nslashed Shanahan.\n\nThe Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it\nwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right\nshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour\ndived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into\nthe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.\n\nThe Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the\nBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds\nremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by\nshooting the puck into the Blues' bench.\n\nChris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and\nMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues'\npower play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway\npoint of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased\nthe Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.\n\nTry as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped\neverything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period\nand 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.\n\nEmerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected\nFelsner's pass.\n\n  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*\n  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % \n  %   \\ \\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * \n  *    \\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % \n  %     \\    ________/                                                   *\n  *      \\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % \n  %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *\n  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % \n  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * \n  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%",

Also,TCI\nand Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the\ncountry with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will\ndo their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the\nNHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC\nand ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime\nSportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports\ncontracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams.\n\n-PPV Mark",

        "subject": "FLYERS notes 4/16",
        "content": "The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but\nKevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,\n7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\nLaFontaine all night.\n\nRoster move:\n\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\nscratch.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-McGill\n\nTommy Soderstrom\n\nGame Summary:\n\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\n\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\nhe was getting bored back there...\n\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\n\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\ndidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\n\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\nRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\nnext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\nend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\n\nHe's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\nfour years if there was a consensus.\n\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\n\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\nall over it.\n\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\n\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\n\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\nset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\n\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\n\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\nangles...\n\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\n\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\n\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\n\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\n\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\n\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\nthe middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.\n\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\nof the season.\n\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\n\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running \nout as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\ncorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\ngame.\n\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\n\nA couple misc notes:\n\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\n\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\n\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\n\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\nrole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t40 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tEric Lindros\t74 1992-93\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tMark Recchi\t121 1992-93*\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t52 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t121\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t84\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t62\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t59\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner",

        "subject": "SHARKS REVIEW Part 3: Defensemen (21-45)",
        "content": "#21\tPETER AHOLA\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the\nPenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been\nspectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);\nit's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\n\n#24\tDOUG WILSON\t\tSeason: 16th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\n\t\t2nd round pick in '92 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\nWilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\n\n#29\tDEAN KOLSTAD\t\tSeason:\t2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (C-/D+)\n\nIt's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\n\n#38\tPAT MACLEOD\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\nhe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\nSince he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\nskills.\n\n#41\tTOM PEDERSON\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+)\n\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\n43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\n\n#45\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D)\n\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\nwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

I don't like to see stickwork,\nbut you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move\n(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back\nof their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of\nbricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm \ntalking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the \nplayer you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid\nretaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of \nposition for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short\nside.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with\nhelpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who\nI have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays\nhuge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)\n\nBarfly",

I also realize that $45 is\nalot of money, especially if you don't normally collect cards. So if enough\npeople are interested, I'll break up the set into team sets. I'm not sure\nhow much for each. It would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but then\nthe people who get the Whalers and Devils (Note, I'm not bagging on these teams\nits just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would\nbe subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh. So I'll have to make\nit varialble pricing. But most of them should be about $2 or $3 dollars.\n\n\n>1991-92 Score Pinnacle (Candian) Sets $45\n\n>This is a very nice set, premium quality cards. Has second year cards of the\n>players above, plus Bure, Potvin, Falloon, and Lindros ($15 value) second year\n>cards,and the following rookie cards: Lidstrom Kamensky, Zelepukin, Roussel,\n>Konstantinov.

        "content": "Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993.\nThe game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although\nI think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.\n\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\n\nTopics\n------\n\nDon's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.\n\nEpisode Summary\n---------------\n\nThis episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was\npointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,\nand Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)\n\nRon Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a\nhotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of\nall the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter\nand Fuhr.\n\nDon began to praise Fuhr, calling him the \"greatest goalie\", and\nsaid that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself.\nHe then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when\nFuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised \"Don't Trade Fuhr!\"\n\nDon went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would\nbe Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the\ntrade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.\n\nThe next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by\ntoo many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver\ngame, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.\nRon said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,\nbut Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi\nhitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: \"Its sad what\nthey're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.\"\n\nNext, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.\nPeople in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke \"Wendy\" for not fighting.\nHowever, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.\n\nThis lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how\nbanning fighting leads to more high sticking: \"It's like college\nhockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.\nThat's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you\nwon't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made\nby people who don't know what's going on in hockey\".\n\nThe final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out\nthat he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip\nof Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was\ntaught to \"play to win\", which differs from today's idea of\njust letting kids have fun.\n\nAt then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's\ncorner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like\none of the chipmunks.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some\ngood quotes.\n\nI'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \\  \\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\n    \\  \\                  |Department of Computing Science,\n     \\  \\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n      \\    ###  \\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\n       \\___###___\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\n\nTopics\n------\n\nDon's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\n\nEpisode Summary\n---------------\n\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\n\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\nwon in their building, we're going to win in ours\".\n\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\nresulting in a goal.\n\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\nthe Leaf players \"Don't let them score on you\".\n\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\ninstant replay.\n\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his\nplay.\n\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\nthat he can't play the way he should, because of the league's\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\nproblems.\n\nDon's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don't fight\nbecause they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\nwouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\n\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\nsomeone gets cut every period.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported\nby Murray.\n\nI'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.",

There wasn't exactly a radical\nshift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The\nonly real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if\nhe stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been\nquoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the\nDucks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,\nand he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder\nwhether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those\ninjuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an\nearthquake collapsed the root cellar.\n\n>Of course, Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal\n>contributions before he was fired, so it's not clear that this would have\n>been different.  Besides, they *were* marginal contributors.\n\nLet's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly\nKisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong\nobjections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do\nwith both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.\n\nImagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine\nhadn't jammed.\n\n>With or without Mullen, they weren't going to be a playoff team; what good\n>does it do them to hang onto a player who'd rather be elsewhere?  \n\nEspecially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not\nthat I'd accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply wasn't there,\nand that kind of thing can affect the team.\n\n>>An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\n>>but not kept, because of his age.

But\n>>you have to find the right balance.\n\n>Right balance for what?  That's the issue.  \n\nExactly. At the time they let Skriko go, we hadn't yet had the major injury\nbugs that killed us later. I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone\nlike Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that wasn't the choice. And since the\nchoice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the\nright choice was made for that time period.\n\n-- \n Chuq \"IMHO\" Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com\n   Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ \n  Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)\n  San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)\n   San Jose Sharks fans: sharks-request@medraut.apple.com (New seat: 127/TBD)",

This is the only place I know to\ncatch all of the Stanley Cup action.\n\nFrank Salvatore\nfmsalvat@eos.ncsu.edu",

        "content": "I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack\nof any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\nregular season game.          PENS RULE!!!",

I guess since you've played a little you thereby \nqualify as an expert.  Especially since you watch all the games on t.v.  All \nthat qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato\n\n> Not that I condone violence, but I'll make an exception for Mario.\nPat Walker\n\nAgain just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are.  Truly a \nstupid statement.  Mario is definately one of the best players to play the game.\nI'm not saying he is the best to ever play the game, but he should come to\nmind when that question is asked.  Let's face it, he just returns from \nradiation therapy with around a dozen games left, overtakes Lafontaine for the\nscoring lead and then buries him!!!!  No, I guess he just got lucky.\nSpeaking of Lafontaine, now there's a guy who should be considered for the\nHart trophy as well, certainly one of the better players in the league this\nyear.",

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald\n was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy\n to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed\n on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest\n periods I've seen Sweden play this year.\n Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many\n times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\n range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,\n and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.\n\n Switzerland:\n\n Goaltender:  20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio)\n Defense:     26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger\n              16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch\n               7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter\n              31 Samuel Balmer\n Forwards:    22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger\n              23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald\n              35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle\n              15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio\n \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0)\n\n 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4:28\n      CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12:20 (pp)\n 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9:40\n      RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16:24\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic\n Attendance: 8,600\n\n Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't\n enough to win against the effective Canadians.\n\n Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just\n deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play\n goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the\n far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.\n Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of\n the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.\n Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya\n entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,\n then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to\n deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.\n The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side\n and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.\n \n Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri\n Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and\n in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,\n and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros\n after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.\n\n Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,\n 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player\n (among those Kariya with 1+6).

He played well when he was put into the lineup at the end of the season - Murray has to sit somebody out, though.  If the Red Wings hadn't played as well as they did in the first game, he may have been in the second.  Why should Murray juggle players when the Wings are dominating Toronto like they are?",

Washington, Abe\nLincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come\nfrom the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties,\nbut wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team\nan advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this\nyear, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about\nbeing hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an\neven bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting\nthem up.)  Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so\nmuch in his life?\n\nGeorge",

Most people I know say that winning the second Cup\nwas better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.\nBut I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm\nto which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.\n\nAs far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right.\nIt's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who\njust don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At\nlast Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a\ngoaltender can get an\nassist.\n\nAnyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen\nat any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to\nthink for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out\nof this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh.\nSpoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through\nthat amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing for\ngranted.  God, look at Chicago...\n\nAnd I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonna\nlast forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.  \n\nMom.",

Daigle has\nshown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,\nand after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being\nstupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a\nrock. \n\nAlso remember that a lot of teh \"draft 1st\" stuff comes from the assumption\nhe'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that \nQuebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current\nstatus. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock\nby any means at this point.\n\nIt's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his\nsigning price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos\nsuspensions.\n\n>IMO I would\n>take Kariya.

Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.\n\n>San Jose will then get Kariya.\n\nNo. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not\nleaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to\nuse a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not\nwhen there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make\nan immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards\nNiedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can\nconvince him to leave school early (which I doubt).\n\n\nMy cut on things as they stand today:\n\n>Draft Order\n>-----------\n>1) Ottawa (60% Daigle, if not, 40% Pronger)\n>2) San Jose 80% Niedermayer, unless Ottawa skips Daigle.

Thanks for the news, Mikko; can you (or any\n>of our Finnish netters) comment on Tichonov?\n\nThe first time I heard this piece of news was on the post game radio\ninterview here in Jyvaskyla. That was the bronze medal game in the \nSM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:)\nlost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach),\nsaid that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to\ntake the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where\never he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (after\nthree? seasons). I don't know why.\n\nVasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced many\nplayers to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) but\nthey had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in the\nplayoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn't\nconsistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any\nteam in the SM-liiga.\n\nI am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wants\nto be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and\ndecide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach but\nmaybe they'll do some compromise.\n\nCould somebody post more information about Vasili? I know he was coaching\nin the former Soviet league; teams, results? His character as a coach?",

He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.\nIn both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres\nthe chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of\nhuge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. \nEven in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to\nindicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been\nfor Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)\nthrough the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open\nup the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on\na breakaway to salt away the game).  There\nis no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the\nvictory. \n\nIn my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as\nLaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get\nextraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev\n(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense\n, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton\nplaying a regular shift afterall ;-)\nThe difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog. \n\nGary\n\nGo Sabres!",

        "content": ">I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly,\n>THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in\n>Texas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or\n>were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever\n>owned the arena doing some price gouging?\n\n\nNorman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years\nthat he has owned the team.  When he bought the team, it seemed kind of\nobvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red,\nbefore the team started making a profit again.  He gave the impression\nthat he was willing to do so.  He claimed two years ago that the team\nneeded to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit,\nbut this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket\nprices.  I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward\ntrend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in\ndeciding to move.  He was even offered the many concessions he rudely\ndemanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at the\nother two arenas in town, etc.\n\nOh well, I guess the bottom line is $$$.  Green wanted immediate huge\nreturns in Dallas, and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN. \nDallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feel\nMinnesota's was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies down\nthere as well.  All this means, is that Minnesota is without an NHL team\nfor a year or two.  Too bad for the NHL.\n\nKEA",

Now, if Probie\ndecides to put Wendel through the boards, he's probably gone, right?\n\n>I don't remember who (on the Leafs) touched the puck \n>on Racine's shot towards the end of the game (43.2 seconds left), but Stewart\n>called it out of play, last touched by Detroit.

The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit\nloss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the\nWings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team.\n\nThe call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his\nstick in somebody's eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I\nhave seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's an\nasshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.

        "content": "From: caldwell8102@mtroyal.ab.ca\n\nNews:\n=====\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \na major part of the team. \n\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \n\nThoughts on Game 1:\n==================\n\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \n\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \n\nThoughts on Game 2:\n==================\n\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \n\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \n\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \n\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \neach other was just roughing?

Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their\nadvantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their\nsuperior powerplay. \n\nMontreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on\nhis way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is\ntruly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four, perhaps five, \nwere quite stoppable. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlan",

The Rangers are certainly within their rights to force Zubov and\nAndersson to report to Binghampton. \n\nIt certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the Ranger \norganization, however.

We all know the Caps\nare famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:\n\n1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,\ngave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the\nlast minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot.\nSeries tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.\n\n2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd \nperiod, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.\n\n3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.\nBlew it and the series.\n\n4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.\n\n5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.\nBlew it again.\n\nWhen they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: \"if they blew this\nlead, the series is OVER\". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders\nbelieve they can come back no matter what the score is.\n\nI am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can \ncompletely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear \nlives in a crucial game.\n\n>The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan.\n>P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh!\nWell, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps\nwere frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking \"wait\nuntil Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire\". Well, they retired (even though\nTrottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another\ngeneration of Islanders were still doing the same thing. Well, I guess \nit has nothing to do with the players.\n\n-- \n                                          Edward Lor\n                                          lor@cbnewsk.att.com",

On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn't one of the three\n\tstars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted\n\tthe playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth\n\tplace....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for\n\taccumulating points from the three star selection) during the\n\tregular season.\n\n\t2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on this\n\tone.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is\n\tone of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the\n\tofficiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever\n\tmissed that slash on Gilmour's hand).\n\n\t3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better\n\tchances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better\n\tagainst the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the\n\tdivision). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'm\n\tsupporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.

When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.\nJoseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there \nwould probably be a game 6 scheduled.  \n\nAs for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.\nOne was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to\ngive them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck\nhit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot\nfor Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis'\ngoals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone\nwho didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.\nFinally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot.\n\nI congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to see\nBryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph\nwon't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n|The World Reknown Jason Boskey           | Mail: Bosk@uiuc.edu            |\n|Known throughout the World as The Bosk   |\"Christ, you know it ain't easy,|\n|All Rights Reserved, All Lefts Enhanced  |You know how hard it can be,    |\n|-----------------------------------------|The way things are goin'        |\n|\"Here they come spinning out of the turn\"|They're gonna crucify me\"       |\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

        "content": "The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost\nidentical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as\nVancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2.\n\tThe pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks\nscoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave\noff a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the \nnumbers that counted: goals.\n\tVancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\n\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \n\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\nthe score 2-1. \n\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\nallowed to set up and make plays.\n\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\n\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\n\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\n\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \nbackhand even though he was off balance. \n\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\nfor their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.\n\tNext game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.\n- 30 -",

Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \n\n>Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87. \n\nOk.

An\n>increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival\n>of Mario Lemieux is what did it. \n\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\namazing, I'll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we've got a *kick*\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\n\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\n>Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They\n>are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement\n>since Gretzky's first year there.  How do you explain it?

They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than\n>they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.\n\nI don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \n\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\n\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \n\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\nmake people around them better.\n\n>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)\n\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\n\n>This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't\n\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>\n\n>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge\n>jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.\n>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because\n>they are winning.\n\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\nSelanne.\n\nI did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the \nCFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If \nthat's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious\nto hear your explanation.",

He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but\nhe's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he\nwere more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away\nthat huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest\ndisappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's\nonly a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though\nnot through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided \nto threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the\naward goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be\nMVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the\nleague's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the \nrest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer\ngoals than Hartford.

According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver\ndollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the\nanniversary of the Stanley Cup.

My question is, since the loon is the only\ndollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative\ncoin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of\nthing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no\nchance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's\nthe current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the\ncrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-\nistically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they\nstill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is \nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \nexamples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\n\n>>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is \n>>true.

However, I'd suggest Kelly\nBuchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for\nthe All-Star game notwithstanding.\n\nAs for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations\nthis year due to his \"breakthrough\" year (for him) last year, so he didn't\nreally raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the\ncallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the\ndepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on\nthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent\nnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league\noblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.\nI think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.\n\nAs for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers\ndumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or\neven Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.\n\n-- \nAndrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com\nHP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253\n\nDuring the Roman Era, 28 was considered old...",

It turns out that the mask is\ncustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a\npiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face\nand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic\nwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.

This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves\npadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  \nJohn Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. \n\n>He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a\n>new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current\n>mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was \n>*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two\n>fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed\n>back-ground.\n\nYeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.\n \n>The best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.\n>It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking \n>black panther on the forehead -- it *has* to be a new mask for Felix\n>Potvin, but he never said whose it was.\n\nActually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.

        "content": "Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter\nof what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\n\nCanadians: 400\nAmericans: 100\nEuropeans: 100\n\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\n25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.\n\n   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick\nof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the\nRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \"Bure\" \"Konstantinov\" and\n\"Borshevshky\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,\nand Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other\nteams is getting worse as well. \n\n    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \"Pavel Bure, the\nRussian Rocket\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \n\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even\nbetter hockey players. It's all hype. This \"European mystique\" is sickening,\nbut until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue\nto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.\n\n    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly\nonly getting worse.\n\n    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures\nand Selannes of the world play on their own continent.\n\n    I just don't want them on mine.\n\n\n \n \n-- \nRichard J.

Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.\n\nRe Eric: True, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be\nlike without Recchi for 30 games.\n\nSoderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot\nof defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring\na ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring\nahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.\n\nEklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42\npoints in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor\nin the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in\nhis career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as\na disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.\n\nMy choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players,\nbut I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest\ndisappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect\ncoach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO\nhas cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year.

        "content": "The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum\nSunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0\nshutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\nmounting any serious attack.\n\nInjuries:\n\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\n\nRoster Moves:\n\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\nold, 6'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\nup front as well.\n\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\n\nLines:\n\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nActon-Brown\n\nGalley-McGill\nYushkevich-Cronin\nCarkner-Hawgood\nBowen\n\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\n\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\n\nGame Summary:\n\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\n\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\nof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\n\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\naway every rebound.\n\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\n\nThe Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\n\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\n\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\ntripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\nBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\n\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\n\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\n\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\nlittle.\n\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\nperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\n\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\n\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\nequal and preserved the shutout.\n\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\nhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\n\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\n\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\nthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't\nremember that he's tied with.\n\nNext up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\nin Washington would be the official end.\n\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\nthan 5 under in 80).\n\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\ngoal for the team to focus on.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t38 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tEric Lindros\t67 1992-93\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tMark Recchi\t117 1992-93\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t51 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t117\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t79\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t58\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t58\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner",

You would think the\n>>>Messiah had returned...\n\n During the latest Philly game the Leaf players didn't parade... Philly\n crunched them 4-0 !!!

I can see the relationship between free\nthrows awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's\nobviously easier to score in basketball, there are more\nopportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's\nat least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken\nby each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is\nprobably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe\n5 of them.

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\n\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\nright side.\n\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\nto make a number of starts in a row.\n\n-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)\n-steveg@cadkey.com",

They give their\ngeneral managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best\nplayers so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is\nin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him\nto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.\n\nWhere do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian\nplayers.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners\ncan do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable\nhere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US\nthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their\nimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.\n\nIncreasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would\nmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the\nlower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some\nthat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm\nclub, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on\nthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian\nplayers in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))\nSo with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players\nin North America.\n\n>\n>    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly\n>only getting worse.\n>\n>    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures\n>and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.\n>\n>    I just don't want them on mine.\n\nI'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the\nworld.

The National Hockey League should love the idea, though.\n>Pan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the\n>American networks likely never will pay.\n\nThis brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned\nthat the NHL could expand in Europe.\n\nWould most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing\nto play for a team in Europe?\n\nI do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily\ninterested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.\n(I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)\n\nWhen one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes\nme wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:\n\n- Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons)\n- Nicholls ... in Edmonton.\n- R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only.\n- C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.\n\nI know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:\n\n- Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french\n  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One\n  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could\n  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.\n\nAnybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved\nto London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league\n(2 years ago?)\n\nI wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.\n\nMyself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be \nthe best way to do it? \n\nMarc",

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\n\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\n\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\n\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\n\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\nthe PA announcer says it.\n\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \nchance of pronouncing his name right.\n\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\n\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\nit truly is a sad day.\n\nEnough for now.\n\ndvb",

All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except \nmatchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3-\n2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season \npoints will choose whether to start the series at home or away.\n\n-----\n\n- Draft news:\n\n        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in \nJune, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one \ngoaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion \ndrafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction \nbetween forwards and defensemen.\n        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down \nfrom the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and \nOttawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.\n        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of \none goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is \nthat a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.\n        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises \nwill have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total \nof 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \nnew teams.\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \n1994.\n\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \n1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a \ndelay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.\n\n-----\n \n- League news:\n\nDisputes:\n\n  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary \narbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

        "content": "After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as\npossible), I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots\nthis year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other\ngoaltenders). I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just\nas examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the\nhead, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens\n(Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of\ncourse he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match\npenalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few\nyears ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in\nmy mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also\nvery good.\n\nHow about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that\ngoes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore.\n\nOh, the playoffs should be fun,\nRalph",

        "content": "Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. \nThe Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\n\n\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot \ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\n\n\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a\ndefenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\nreally trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \ngood fight once in a while, but only when it's \"called for\".  You know, when a\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \nI'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\nreferee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.\n\nJust My Honest Opinion,\n\nGary at Hofstra\nACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU\nACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET",

It is Mats Sundin and\n Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late\n stage of the tournament.

Dammit,\neven Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs\na power forward with some talent, IMO.\n\nThen watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say\nwhat you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. \nAnd Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. \nLast night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came\non the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he\ndidn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.

Go Habs!!\n\nFinal\n>Boston vs. Montreal:\n>Will Bruin domination continue in this rivalry? Yes. Moog has\n>consistently outperformed Roy in the playoffs (after 1986)..[other stuff]\n> Bruins in five.\n\nI can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for\n6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play\nin the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't\nbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will\nnot be putting money on this series. :-)\n\n>Patrick Division, semifinal\n\n>Pittsburgh vs. NY Islanders:\n>What can I say? The Pens are flying high and have the most talent in\n>the league. \n\nAgreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent\nof the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is\ncredit to NY.\n\n>Washington vs. New Jersey:\n>CAPITALS IN 5.\n\nAgreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent\nteam, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.\n\n>Pittsburgh vs. Washington:\n>If the Caps had Bill Ranford I might see an upset, but Don Beaupre\n>just doesn't inspire my hopes.  PENGUINS IN 6.\n\nI think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't\nthink it will go six either...*maybe* five.\n\n>CONFERENCE FINAL:\n>Pittsburgh vs. Boston:\n>A replay of last year. The Penguins are just as good as 12 months ago,\n>and the Bruins are much improved. But... PENGUINS IN 6.\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They\nown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once\nagain I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\n\n>Campbell Conference, Norris Division, semifinal\n\n>Chicago vs. St. Louis (or Minnesota):\n> BLACKHAWKS IN 5.\n\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,\nIMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.\n\n>Detroit vs. Toronto:\n>The Leafs have had an excellent season, but they've been playing\n>playoff hockey all year - the Habs under Burns were the same way and\n>always wilted in the playoffs.  RED WINGS IN 5.\n\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\n\n>FINAL:\n>Chicago vs. Detroit:\n> This will be a war. Fedorov will win it in OT. RED WINGS IN 7.\n\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\n\n>Smythe Division SEMI-FINALS:\n\n>Vancouver vs. Winnipeg:\n> CANUCKS IN 7.\n\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\n\n>Calgary vs. Los Angeles:\n>This would have been tough to call, except for three things. 1/ The\n>Kings don't have a goalie; 2/ Gary Roberts will be back; 3/ the Kings\n>shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner (Paul Coffey)\n>for a proven loser (Jimmy Carson). Gretzky is just too weary to carry\n>this group. FLAMES IN 5.\n\nThis is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. \nI don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a\nnon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate\nGretzky.  LA in six.\n\n>FINAL:\n>Vancouver vs. Calgary:\n> FLAMES IN 6.\n\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be\nLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.\n\n>COFERENCE FINAL:\n>Detroit vs. Calgary:\n> RED WINGS IN 7.\n\nWow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked\nLA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.\n\n>STANLEY CUP FINAL:\n>Pittsburgh vs. Detroit:\n>Three in a row and official 'dynasty' status for the Pens? Or can the\n>Wings complete a dream season? Well, the Wings are better in goal (not\n>sufficiently so though IMHO) and have better D-men. However, Mario and\n>the boys can sure score. Look for Jagr to shine in the playoffs,\n>though I sure would love to see Probert beat some sense into him. The\n>Pens are just too much, especially since Detroit will have a tougher\n>battle to get here. PENGUINS IN 5.\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet\nagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\nbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\nthough, I'd have to take the Penguins.\n\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\nall-round players in the NHL.\n\n\n\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca",

But that is\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\nrather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm\n\n-- \nRoger Maynard \nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca",

Since Hartford is pitiful, the\nIslanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most\nlikely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor\nshooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit\nthe broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of\nit.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?  I don't know if that would\nhelp, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some\nlight on the subject.\n\nAnd, my playoff pool is running!!!

        "subject": "FLYERS notes 4/17",
        "content": "The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,\na 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing\nthe future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time\nalmost bearable.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 34 assists, 75 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t40 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tEric Lindros\t75 1992-93\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n53 goals, 70 assists, 123 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tMark Recchi\t123 1992-93*\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t53 1992-93*\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t123\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t86\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t62\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t59\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner",

The ruling in\nCohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision\nin the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial\nLawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest\nlaw firm representing the women athletes.\n   \"This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a\nschool wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of\nopportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,\"\nsaid TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.\n   The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that\nprohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions\nreceiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as\nuniversity-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to\ncompete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for\nuniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also\nbeen denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.\n   \"This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,\"\nsaid TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &\nLabinger.  \"Universities across America need to reevaluate their\nprograms quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced.\"\n   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State\nUniversity, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and Colgate\nUniversity are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders\nrequiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity\nteams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is\nrepresenting women athletes at IUP.\n   In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included:\nRay Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca\n& Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  The\nNational Women's Law Center, Women's Sports Foundation, and National\nAssociation for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in\nsupport of TLPJ's appeal.\n -30-",

The puck clearly hit the crossbar\nand then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,\nkept harping about how they \"must have had a different view upstairs\"\nbecause it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who\nsaw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally \nsignalled no goal but the video replay \"judges\" initiated contact with\nthe referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is\nunheard of.

It is much easier to be an element of change\n\nHardly.  The \"established\" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.\nThe  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team\ncould successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did\nwas formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-\nolistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-\ner  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly\ndebatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-\nbate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people\nplayed hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe\nand his pals showed up.\n\n>or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates\n>a new situation.  If you want to honor players like Bobby Orr than I'm sure\n>you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive \n>defenseman.\n\nWhat's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better\ndefenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that\nBruce Norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby\nOrr's  then,  in the interests of education, why don't you take a poll\nand find out how many people know who Norris was?  But you don't  have\nto, do you?\n\n>No I can't for the reasons I gave above.

If a 10 year old _American_\n>can learn this why would it be hard for an \"Occasional Fan\" to pick up \n>on who plays in what division?\n\nSo you don't feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember\nthat  Vancouver  plays in the West division?

Quoting me out of context does\nmore to erode your credibility than it  does  mine.   My  position  is\nclearly  progressive  and  is anything but \"biased, closed minded, ig-\nnorant\".  Arrogant, I will grant you.\n\n>arrogant, and moronic as you.

Best \nstrategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.\nTaylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,\nwhen the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell\nand will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.\n\n     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; \nwhat's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).\n\nOthers can add on their opinions as well.\n\nKevin L.

        "content": "The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period\nand the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium.\nBrendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17\nseconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\n\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\n10-9 in the first period.\n\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\n\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\n\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\ndeflected the puck in the net.\n\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\n\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\n\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\nangle.\n\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\n\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\nin the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on\non four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in\nthe league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.\n \nThe game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an\nAll-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when\nCBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday\nin St. Louis.\n\nBox score\n---------\nBlues 4, Blackhawks 3\n\nBLUES       0    2    2   --   4\nCHICAGO     1    2    0   --   3\n\nFIRST PERIOD\n\n   CHI -- Noonan 1 (Larmer, K.Brown), 8:17.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (holding), 2:28; Zombo, StL (interference), 6:00;\nMurphy, Chi (high-sticking), 11:30; Grimson, Chi (boarding), 14:39; Zombo, StL\n(holding), 18:46.\n\nSECOND PERIOD\n\n   STL -- Brown 1 (Shanahan, Emerson), 3:12.\n   CHI -- (PPG) Noonan 2 (Roenick, Chelios), 5:40.\n   CHI -- Noonan 3 (Matteau, Sutter), 8:51.\n   STL -- Felsner 1 (McRae, Janney), 12:49.\n\n   Penalties -- Baron, StL (interference), 4:33; Wilson, StL (tripping), 9:31.\n\nTHIRD PERIOD\n\n   STL -- (PPG) Shanahan 1 (J.Brown, Hull), 11:12.\n   STL -- (PPG) Hull 1 (Emerson, J.Brown), 11:29.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (roughing), 1:54; Matteau, Chi (high-sticking),\n9:56; Smith, Chi (slashing), 10:49; Baron, StL (roughing), 14:23.\n\nSHOTS ON GOAL\n\nBLUES       10    10     7   --   27\nCHICAGO      9     5    13   --   27\n\nPower-play Opportunities -- St. Louis 2 of 4; Chicago 1 of 7.\n\nGoaltenders -- St. Louis, Joseph, 1-0-0 (27 shots-24 saves).\n               Chicago, Belfour, 0-1-0 (27-23).\n\nReferee -- Kerry Fraser.

Any other \n\nThe Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach\nera, when Darryl Sittler was called a \"cancer on the team\", he tore the\nC off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.\n\nSittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly\ncaptaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead,\nSittler got traded to Detroit.\n\nRick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and\nthey took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.\n\nDuring Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss\nthe  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad\nMarsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried\nto give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.\n\nThe best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late\nof the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably\none of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of\nplaying coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be-\ncame the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a\ncaptain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the\nplayers.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making\nsure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.\n\n\n-- \n\ncordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \n                                           \"So many morons...\nrm                                                   ...and so little time.\"",

Can't believe people actually put\n>win as first in a tie breaker......\n\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\nwin.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\nthat's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\nhad the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,\nmaybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.\n:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller\t\t\t\tLET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\t\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!\n\n            \"When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you.\"",

Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren\nRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed\nto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think\nVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,\nas Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King\ninserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's\ngame.

The goalie\nwho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series\nfor his team.\n\nEposode Summary\n---------------\nThis episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that\nhe bought from the concession stand.\n\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\nof me. Beauty.\"\n\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\nthe arenas in the NHL.\n\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\n\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\nand the AHL championships.\n\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\nwent cold.\n\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\nbe a 'country club'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves... If\nthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the\nyardarm by their thumbs.\"\n\n\nRating\n------\nNothing too special in this episode.\n\nI'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \\  \\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\n    \\  \\                  |Department of Computing Science,\n     \\  \\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n      \\    ###  \\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\n       \\___###___\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

A truly great GM would\nhave been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon\nof the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can\nmaintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.\n\nIn the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-\nway too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.\nHe fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and\nQuinn in my estimation.\n\nI can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen\nin hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.\n\nGregmeister",

YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one\nof the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!).

Munich does have an arena. \n\n> Sweden       : Stockholm, Gothenburg (Malmo, Gavle)\n\nMalmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has \n5,000 seats I think.\n\n> Finland      : Helsinki (Turku, Tampere)\n\nIf we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work.\nTurku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for\nmajor league hockey.\n\n> Italy        : Milan\n\n...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africa\nto hockey fans. Romans were given the chance to host some WC'94 games but\nshowed no interest whatsoever.

Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning\nanyway; playing in a small 10,000 seat arena, backed by Japanese money, run by \nenthusiasts (Phil Esposito), heavy\nmarketing, fans that have difficulty telling what \"icing\" means... London has\nbeen mentioned, Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new\nmega-facility (16,000 seats!) might be built in Bristol in a couple of years.\n\n> Netherlands  : ?\n\nNo facilities to speak of; their biggest arena (in Eindhoven) seats 2,500 \nfans for hockey. \n> \n> Petteri Kortelainen\n\nMARCU$",

Come on,\nJoe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.\nWhy they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams\nis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two\ngoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good\nteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\nof comparing two goaltenders.\n\n> > The fact of the matter is that, despite last nights shutout, he doesn't\n> > have what it takes.

Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\ndoesn't have a game like that in him.\n\n> Well if you look back to November when Roussel was the #1 goalie (Soderstrom\n> was being treated for his heart ailment).

FLYERS management never says bad thing about\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen\nat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was\nto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,\nDom has played well too.\n\n> By the way, what was the final card on Monday night?

        "content": "Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have\naffected the AHL this year.\n\n\nST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS\nThe St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by\nproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\nwill return to St John's once the strike ends.\n===================================================\nSENATORS SOLD\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \n\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\n==================================================\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n============================================================\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n=========================================================\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\n======================================================\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\nSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\n=====================================================\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\n=====================================================\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\n\nONE OPTION\t\t\t\tANOTHER OPTION\n\t\t\t\nNorthern Division\t\t\tSouthern Division\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\t\t\tADIRONDACK\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\t\t\tSPRINGFIELD\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\t\t\tPROVIDENCE\nCD ISLANDERS\t\t\t\tCDI\nPORTLAND PIRATES\t\t\tHERSHEY\n\t\t\t\t\tBINGHAMTON\nSouthern Division\t\t\tROCHESTER\nHERSHEY BEARS\t\t\t\tHAMILTON\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\t\t\tUTICA\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\t\t\tAtlantic Division\nUTICA (?)

        "subject": "SHARKS REVIEW Part 1: Goaltenders",
        "content": "As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,\ntrying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through\nfor the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\nkill them.\n\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\n\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\n\n#1\tBRIAN HAYWARD\t\tSeason:\t11th\nAcquired:\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tP (D)\n\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\n\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\n\n#30\tJEFF HACKETT\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tC\n\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\nyear.\n\n#31\tWADE FLAHERTY\t\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\nAcquired:\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\nGrade:\t\tI (A-)\n\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\nmay not ever.\n\n#32\tARTURS IRBE\t\tSeason:\t1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\n\n  35.

After a \n> couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the \n> Nordic  (presuming that our teams would have the advantage in  drafting \n> local talent, as prooposed).\n\nThat's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &\nAmerican Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our\nset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\n---\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\n\n(28-30=superstar)\n(23-27=star)\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\n(13-17=NHL regular)\n( 8-12=role player)\n\nFINLAND:  \n\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\n\nC-Jari Kurri........25\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\n\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\n\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\n(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\n\nSWEDEN:\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\nD-Calle Johansson...18\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\n\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\nC-Thomas Steen......18\n\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\nR-Michael Nylander..13\n\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\nL-Jan Erixon........14\n\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\n---\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\nisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\nwon't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \ncouple of years the same way Edmonton's \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late '80s. \nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a \ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \n\n> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>  J O O   J O O   J O K E R I T  !  !  !

ESPN had\nprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had\ncontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal\nwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this\none-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the\nseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by\nsqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota\ngame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball\ntelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last\nnight).\n\nBut the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They\nmust honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something\nto do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of\ncontract with baseball.\n\nSo relax.  I'm happy.

The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\ntries.\n\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\n\n1st period: \n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\nin 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\n\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\nthe period.\n\n2nd period: \nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\n\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\n\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\n\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\n\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\n\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\n\n3rd period:\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\n\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\n\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\n\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\n\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \n8:19) took penalties.  \n\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\n\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\n\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\nright out of the game.\n\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\npenalty killing.\n\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\n\nNotes:\n------\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\n\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\n\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\n\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \ngames.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play\nover their last 9 games.\n\nThe teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.\n\nPlayoffs:\nCampbell Conference:\nSmythe Division:\nLA  6  @ CAL 3 \t\tLA leads 1-0\nWIN    @ VAN\n\nNorris Division:\nSTL 4  @ CHI 3\t\tSTL leads 1-0\nTOR    @ DET\n\nWales Conference:\nAdams Division:\nBUF 5  @ BOS 4 (OT)\tBUF leads 1-0\nMON 2  @ QUE 3 (OT)\tQUE leads 1-0\n\nPatrick Division:\nNJ  3  @ PIT 6\t\tPIT leads 1-0\nNYI 1  @ WAS 3\t\tWAS leads 1-0\n\nRecords:\n--------\nvs\tSmythe\t Norris\t Patrck\tAdams\tOverall\n================================================\nHome:    0- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    0- 0-0 \nRoad:    1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    1- 0-0\n==============================================================\nTotal:   1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0\t0-0-0\t 1- 0-0  \n\nBox Score:\n=========================\nCalgary      0 1 2 - 3\nLos Angeles  1 3 2 - 6\n=========================\n\n1st period: \nLA  Sydor 1 (Gretzky, Sandstrom), 0:16\n    LA  Millen - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Fleury - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Skrudland - interference, 12:25\n    LA  Carson - tripping 14:53\n    CAL Dahlquist - holding stick, 18:34\n    CAL Dahl - roughing 19:30\n\n2nd period: \n    CAL Verson - delay of game (served by Ashton), 1:34\nCAL Suter 1 (Fleury), 2:48 (sh)\nLA  Carson 1 (Shuchuk, Sydor), 3:13 (pp)\nLA  Huddy 1 (Taylor, Rychel), 3:37\nLA  McSorley 1 (unassisted), 6:36\n    CAL Skrudland - elbowing, 10:53\n    LA  Sydor - tripping, 12:35\n    LA  Watters- hooking, 14:40\n    LA  McSorley - holding, 17:19\n    CAL Suter - high sticking, 17:31\n    LA  Sandstrom - hooking, 18:03\n\n3rd period:\nLA  Millen 1 (Granato, Donnelly), 1:06\n    LA Sydor - hooking, 1:24\n    CAL Nieuwendyk - tripping, 3:22\nCAL Dahlquist 1 (Otto), 4:23\n    CAL Fleury - major (boarding), game misconduct, 6:08\n    LA  Granato - tripping, 6:44\n    LA  Watters - interference, 8:19\nCAL Yawney 1 (MacInnis, Reichel), 8:47\n    CAL MacInnis - roughing, 9:56\nLA  Carson 2 (Sandstrom, Robitaille), 10:32 (pp)\n    LA  Hardy - holding, 11:38\n    CAL Skrudland - slashing, 16:17\n    CAL Stern - double roughing, cross-checking, 10 min. misconduct, 16:17\n\nOvertime: none\n\nShots:\n------\nLos Angeles   8  9 14 - 31\nCalgary       5  8 11 - 24\n\nPower play conversions:\n-----------------------\nFor:      2 of 10; for the year:  2 of  10,  20.00%\nAgainst:  0 of  8; for the year:  8 of   8, 100.00%\n\nGoalies:\n--------\nLos Angeles - Hrudey (1-0-0)\nCalgary - Vernon (0-1-0)\n\nAttendance: 18,605\n\nScratches:\n----------\nRob Blake - back contusion\nGuy Leveque - numbers\nLonnie Loach - numbers\nMarc Potvin - numbers\nBrandy Semchuk - numbers\nRobb Stauber - numbers\nBrent Thompson - numbers\nJim Thomson - numbers\n\nLines - Forwards:\n----------------\n*Robitaille - Gretzky - Sandstrom \nDonnelly - Millen - Kurri\nRychel - Conacher - Taylor\nGranato - Carson - Shuchuk\n\nLines - Defense:\n----------------\n*Huddy - Sydor\nWatters - Zhitnik\nHardy - McSorley\n\n* denotes starting lineup\n\nNext game:\n----------\nWednesday, April 21 @ Calgary Flames; 6:30pm Pacific Time on Prime Ticket\n===============================================================================\nStan Willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com)\nnet contact: L.A.

I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said\nthat he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.\nIf Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup\nby now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim\nand he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\nenough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\nBut Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\nso none of this is true anyway.\n\nGregmeister",

He does so many subtle things behind the play.\n\nHe said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad\nstressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to\nlearn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took\nthat advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived\nin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't\nand wouldn't play a lick of defense.\n\nIt's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought\nall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has\ncertainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at\nthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up\npermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it\nwouldn't matter.\n\nIf I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would\nbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that\ngoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're\nMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;\nhe literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an\nexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\ngoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,\nStewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.\n\nMontreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\ntraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \nNormally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \nfive, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \nESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't\nthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \nthe zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to \nplay.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\n\nDemers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let\nthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this\narticle, if possible.\n\n>Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal.

Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,\nIMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.\n\nSpeaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \nArmy.  \n\nBut I still hate the team.\n\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a\npowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. \nSame goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is\nwaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New\nJersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is\nunbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I \nhate that team anyway.\n\n\n\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca (pissed-off Habs fan)",

In addition, I do not\nthink that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of\npeople that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.\n\nIf the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not \ncentral to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is\nwhether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'\nwould have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to\nplay in.

I have asked on the Sharks\nmailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copy\nback.  If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will\nre-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.\n\n#8\tLARRY DEPALMA\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Minnesota\nGrade:\t\tI (C-/D+)\n\nNo netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at\nthe end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he\nwasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on\nthe waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n\t\tpick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:\t\tA/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:\t\tI (B-/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

He works\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\nto make the team next year.\n\n#3\tDAVID WILLIAMS\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\nGrade:\t\tC/C-\n\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\n'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\nplaymaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\n\n#4\tJAYSON MORE\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nAfter being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp\nbefore '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\n\n#5\tNEIL WILKINSON\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB-\n\nWilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\n\n#6\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (A)\n\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\nbut he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\n\n#19\tDOUG ZMOLEK\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB\n\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

Last year they\ndid a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick\nexit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour\nshould be able to out hustle this line.

        "content": "From: \"nigel allen\" <nigel.allen@canrem.com>\n\n\nHere is a press release from the White House.\n\n Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team\nApril 19; Q&A Following\n To: National Desk\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript\nof remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \"Black\nBears\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:\n\n                           The Rose Garden\n\n 9:58 A.M. EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\n(Applause.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.\n(Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)\n\n                             * * * * * *\n\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\nthis morning, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\ntalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and\ntalk some more.\n\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\ncompromise is no compromise.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.\nWe'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good\nabout it.\n\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\n\n                                 END       10:10 A.M.

You're not good at math. But bear\nwith me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as \ngetting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd\nhave two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also\nhave two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are\ndifferent.\n\nPerhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again.

Some of the guys on the list you\ngave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue\nback and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-\nthat is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better \nthan yours or yours than mine?

Which leads to below:\n\n>and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\n>enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\n\nI think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here\nwhich transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for \nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\nimprove as a result.\n\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how\ngood of a GM he really is.\n\n>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\n>so none of this is true anyway.\n\nI may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing\nit with you.\n\n>Gregmeister\n\n--Randy",

Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by \nYoung in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy.

But the goal itself was a great piece of work\nby Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the\npuck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\n\nYaska  ! yaska@eecg.toronto.edu !

The idea was that youngsters could\nplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these\nolder guys did not. \nAnd they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he\nwasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic\nin thinking they could make up for his contributions.\nAn example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\nbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent\ncontributor worth keeping around.\n\nThe youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who\nmight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But\nyou have to find the right balance.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSteve Cole  (steve@sep.stanford.edu, apple!sep!steve)\nDepartment of Geophysics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305",

        "content": "To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:\n\n  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people \nin the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. \nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \nwhich may happen.\n\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't \nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see \nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\tSo, Minnesota may end up \ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\n\n\t\n\tGo Sabres!\n\t\n\tRobert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)\n\trandolin@polisci.umn.edu",

Smith\ncame out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the\nback of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what\nhappened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never\nhad a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan\nof Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. \n\nIt was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie\nat the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting\nin pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of \ntheir own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the \ngoaltender, or whatever.\n\nAnd to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only\nsay that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.\nThere was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late\nin the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the team\nhas to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlan",

        "content": "By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\n\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\n\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\nWith the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.\n\n``It wasn't pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but\nit did.\"\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It's a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that's all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\n\nSome players didn't have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\" said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.\n\n``I didn't know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,\nand that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend.\"\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\"\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he's happy.\"\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"\n\n  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*\n  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % \n  %   \\ \\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * \n  *    \\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % \n  %     \\    ________/                                                   *\n  *      \\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % \n  %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *\n  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % \n  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * \n  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%",

So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in\n\n\n\nfluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.\n\nPersonally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced \"European\" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on.\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         \nI stand by all the misstatements that I've made.\n\t\t-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89\n\nMe Too -- Nick Duncan <duncan@mprgate.mpr.ca>",

If you check the THN stats for\nKansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the\n4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM).

He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\nmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\nbad judgement call.\n\n\n>#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\n>Acquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\n>Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\n> He\n>is very unlikely to be back next season.\n\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\nhustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\nretirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\nnow is the Gulls.\n\n>#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\n>Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\n>Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\n>I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n>14 games he played this season.\n\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\nfairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he\nwas quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.\n\n> He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.\n\nAgreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you\nwish they'd performed than how they actually performed.

I wonder if he spent\nhis early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing\nthis job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say\nabout the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC\nChicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.

I mean, it was the\nFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous\npenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \"delay of game\"\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3\nskating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans\nwere starting to come up strong.\nI am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.\nIf you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not\nable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to\nadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most\nother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the\nOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish\nspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see\nall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best\nteam/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team\nlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to\nadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team\nto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).\nBut, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as\nthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)\nGermans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all\nultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a\ngreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience\nmost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as\na big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we\njust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers\ncorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all\nAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging\naround beeing drunk on ferries...). \nIn my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you\ndon't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.\n\nThomas\n\n\n\"There's no time to hate, barely time to wait\" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter)",

        "content": "1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.\n--------------------------------\nPlayoffs:\n---------\n*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme\nby Rick Sadowski, Daily News\n\nBarry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the\ncrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with\nthe rookie goaltender.\n\n\"I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most\nfun time of the year, and I'm not,\"  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  \"I\nthink I have worked hard enough for that.\"\n\nStauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie\nin their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\n6-3 opening victory.\n\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\n\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.\n\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\nSaddledome popcorn.\n\n\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I'd be\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\nplayoffs.\"\n\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\n\nWhile insisting he is the Kings' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \nVancouver on Thursday.\n\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\ngreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\"\n\n\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\nmore from him than he does.\"\n\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\n\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\n\n\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry \ndoesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm\na perfectionist.\"\n\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \neven though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's \na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \nyou're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain \nto him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I \ndo know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\"\n\nMelrose's \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \"Before\nyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\n\n------\n\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \nChannel 7 here in LA.  The Kings averaged a 2.1 Nielsen rating in the 10 regular\nseason games aired on Channel 5.\n\nAround the NHL:\n---------------\n*San Jose fired Coach George Kingston, who lead the team to a 11-71-2 mark in \ntheir 2nd NHL season.  Kingston was 28-129-7 over the past 2 years with the\nSharks.\n\n------\n\n*Former Islander executive Bill Torrey was named as President of the expansion\nFlorida Panthers.

Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\n on the 1-3 goal.\n\n Lines information follows further below.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\n Attendance: 3,500\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Group B results:\n\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\n\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\n Attendance: 10,200\n\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\n\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\n Attendance: 2,800\n\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\n whole game).

Pros arrive late, nervousness for\n rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things\n hard to get it going against these \"worse\" nations.\n I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better\n it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.\n\n Some other reasons why the \"worse\" teams are so tough to beat was presented\n by Hans \"Virus\" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).\n\n 1) The \"worse\" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)\n    have now usually world class goalies.\n\n 2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much\n    less unnecessary penalties.\n\n 3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them \"run out of gas.\"\n\n 4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.\n\n>  The only convincing winner was...

Too bad nobody is in front\nmost of the time.\n\nDo you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique\ngets knocked down?  It's disgusting.  We also have Lebeau (5'10\", 172)\ngetting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6'3\", 205) with no reply\nfrom the team, except to yell for a penalty.  Dammit, Denis Savard \nthrew the best (only?)

The third \nperiod at least provided something to look forward to.  Habs won the\nperiod, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a\ncouple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game\nhad started at 7:30.  Hopefully they play that way at home.  Roy made \nthe saves (we'll ignore that second goal), so now it's up to the team.\n\n\n--\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca\n\n\nP.S.

A low GAA against good\n> teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\n> of comparing two goaltenders.\n\nLet's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n> The same\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\ntickets next season:-).\n\n                                         \\ \\\nJoe Dakes                                 \\/\\\nAT&T Microelectronics                      \\/\\\n555 Union Boulevard                         \\ \\\nAllentown, PA  18103                     LET'S GO FLYERS! \nalux1!jmd                                     \\ \\\njmd@aluxpo.att.com                             \\ \\__________\n                                                \\____/_//__/",

From a farm out\n|> in Boondock, Saskatchewan or Weedville, Alberta.\n|> \n\nThe biggest advantage that kids from Boondock or Weedville have is the\navailability of ice.  In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000\nand that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,\nBritish Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There\nare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here\nit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid\nwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say \"what does he know? He's from\nCalifornia.\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,\na town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was\non skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational\nhockey for about 35 years.\n\n|> >When was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city.\n|> >The insurance alone is a big enough barrier.\n|> \n|> The inner city isn't the only place that is poor.\n|> I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.\n\n\nLack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\n\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an\nindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther\nKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown\n(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west\nof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.\nDublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive\nto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice\ntime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them\ngive you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and\ninclude the resurfacing time in the fee.\n\n\n-- \nAlan Hepburn           \"A man doesn't know what he knows\nNational Semiconductor       until he knows what he doesn't know.\"\nSanta Clara, Ca              \nalan@berlioz.nsc.com                              Thomas Carlyle",

As the person who first brought up the\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\nwould argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\nplay.\n\nIn my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\n\n(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.

The Admirals\naren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club\nand a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's\nMilwaukee Bucks play there as well.\n\nCharlie Betz\nCray Research, Inc.

For the Bruins, it was the stuff of\nnightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  \n   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three\ngames of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a\nbest of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this\ntime.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.\n   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice\nadvantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It\nwasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.\n   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting\ngoaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.\nBuffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on\nthe powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.\nLaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was\nKhmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres\nstole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and\nHannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a\nshot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob\nSweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of\npenalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get\nhis first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes\nlater, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied\nthe game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.\nLast year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet\nrevenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a\ntip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.\nBoth teams finished with 34 shots.  \n        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.\n        Referee--Rob Shick.\n\nComments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of\nclutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic\nagain.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead\nflung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea\nto Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever\nheard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was\nonly five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no\none took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,\nnoted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was\ntoo loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as\nmost of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev\ndidn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't\nskate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each\nwere out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in\nan interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he\nresponed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than\nthat, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The\ninterviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he\nmust not understand playoffs.

Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost\nGrillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep\nthose three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston, which, of course, is now\na moot point). \n\nThe Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly\nconsensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There\nwere conflicts. Ferriera lost. That says nothing about his skills or\naccomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics. \n\nI think he did some good things for the Sharks, but that he never fit in as\na \"Shark person\".

But, one\nelement of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.\n\nDespite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing\nadantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and\nkeep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens\nbottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to\nconfigure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new\nlooks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.\n\nBowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an\nindividual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed\nof Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As\na result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played\nalmost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern\nscored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.\nHis ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is\ncommendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might\nsimply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about\nsuccess.\n\nWhile no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson,\nBowman, in his own way, has made himself a permanent, though not clearly\nseen, mark in  Pittsburgh.",

In general, you\nshould expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,\nthere is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain\nand discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another\nplayer. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That\ntwo hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of\nrespect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He\ndid not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the\nslot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he\nslashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a\nLeaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I\nwas very disappointed.\n\nYou're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least\nin his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and\nfor that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's\nwhy their names always comes up as examples when we talk about\nthese issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd\nhate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like\nhim very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but\nintentional) use of the stick.\n\nGary",

He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD\nepisode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt\nit slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).

Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the\nlast period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury\nsuffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for\nthe playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an \nItalian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!!

The\nrest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason\nthey got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the\ncoaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort\npossible out of his team.

The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a\ntesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out\nin the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The\nSabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in\nthe opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in\nsuch ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres\nwon a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game)\nwhen LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his\nshot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps\nover to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting\nit up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming,\n\"They score, THEY SCORE!!!\".

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a\nlot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.\nIt is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the\nsame team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally\ngood players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare\nbetween players on different teams.\n\nI agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful\nare the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is\na missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring\nthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a\nbetter stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice\ntime actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low\namounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who\ndoesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of\nquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that\nthinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than\n+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.\n\n+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.\nYou are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see\nthat being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed\nis a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.\n\nGregmeister",

I think Joey C. did a good\njob filling in when he was asked to.  I can't imagine that it's\neasy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer.  I don't\nseem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too\nmuch, or failing to clear the zone.  He worked hard, and at\nleast didn't make any rookie mistakes.  As he said himself in an\ninterview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.  \n\n>\n>Ranger fans may be suffering but we're some of the most loyal, unlike Islander\n>fans who only show up when the team wins.\n>\n\nAbsolutely.

It is quite possible that\nthe deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\nrenegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\n\nNorthlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\nbut the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.\n\nAs for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly\nsupportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market\nteam, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\nthat the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\nthan many teams in larger cities did.

We\nalso get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The\nGrapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach\nabout what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don\nisn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were\nDon got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the\nBoston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill\nme in on this info?\n  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday\nmorning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off\nsometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave\nhigh praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not\njust a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player\nin the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour\nis a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman\nabout a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?\n  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from\ncity to city.\n  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>\n              is the best two-way player in the league today.'\n \n  There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he\nbasically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.\n  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario\nLemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs\nfrom the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the\nWales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about\nLemieux.

        "content": "I knew, despite the lack of a full game telecast last week, it was still\ntoo much hockey for Atlanta. Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any\nplayoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16,\nthey will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this\nis still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but\nit is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.\n\n\nI asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was\nnot that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time\nwithout much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon\nis usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.\nShe told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf\nwas shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come\ncontractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She\nthen couldn't give me a coherent answer.\n\n\nAlso, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game\nattendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks\nshould begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with\n thier sports programming.\nI hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain\nbitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts\nsince they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.\n\nThe lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. Sometimes, the reason\nis low ratings. Then another time, she says contractual obligations.",

What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays\nreally well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths\nis not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he\nallowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you\nshould get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third\nperiod.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they\nwould not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular\ngoalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they\nare occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like\nSakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there \nare any legitimate excuses. \n\n>Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces \n>[description of lucky bounces.....]\n>Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... \n\nI am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.

My main concern is the second \ngoal.\n\n>This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,\n>as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\n>were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave\n>up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\n\nWhat you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the \ngame was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you\ncould watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what\nif's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final\nresult is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and\nemail you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive\nscrewups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie\nis the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is\nfocussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*\ngoal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.\n\n>>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\n\n>And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. \n\nWHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally\nunrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if\nyou're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key\nsaves at the key times.\n\n>Roy is paid big money because\n>that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5\n\nFor the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in\nthe league.  In fact, I agree that he is.\n\n>The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory\n>comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans.\n                            \nI assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think\nthe loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've\nmade any other 'derogatory comments'.

North-ame-\nricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average\neuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better \nskater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL\nare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league\ngame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many \nbreakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in\nNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because\nof clumsy defensemen.\n\nI have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars\naren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans\nare in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the\nclass of his own). \n\nTommi",

I think he would make a good police officier!!!\n\nAs for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either\nmakes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck \ntowards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't\nstay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or \ncommitts a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!\n\nAs far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps.\nTwo good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first\nround. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they\nshould play well against Jersey tonite.

        "content": "4/23/93    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN, LEAD SERIES 3-0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIt was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and\nthe Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were\ncheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the\nentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning\nhours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis\nPost-Disptach. Enjoy...\n\nBy Dave Luecking\nOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:\n\nAt 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues\ngoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the\nthe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than\nJoseph.\"  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to\nthe verge of a surprising sweep.\n\nJoseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks\n3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0\nlead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nThe Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second\nperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,\na Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the\nfirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only\ntwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.\n\nThe Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,\na nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had\nonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept\nPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to\nmake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the\nBlackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.\n\nWell, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at \nevery opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues\nwere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.\n\nThe Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --\nwore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.\nThe grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and\nscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.\n\nCraig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each\nperiod. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise\nChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and\nrookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final \nperiod.\n\nBlues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling\n``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.\" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour \n``Bell-Four. Bell-Four.\" They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.\"\n\nSuch talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are\non a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.\n\nThe Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first\nminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan\ndumped Steve Smith at center ice.\n\nChicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph\nbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.\n\nThe Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a\nscare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to\nSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw\nat him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph\nabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly\nstyle is deadly.\n\nRookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the\nperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two\nshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the\npuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.\n \nMarouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.\nHe caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third\npenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,\nand gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu\nslashed Shanahan.\n\nThe Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it\nwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right\nshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour\ndived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into\nthe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.\n\nThe Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the\nBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds\nremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by\nshooting the puck into the Blues' bench.\n\nChris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and\nMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues'\npower play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway\npoint of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased\nthe Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.\n\nTry as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped\neverything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period\nand 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.\n\nEmerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected\nFelsner's pass.\n\n  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*\n  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % \n  %   \\ \\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * \n  *    \\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % \n  %     \\    ________/                                                   *\n  *      \\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % \n  %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *\n  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % \n  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * \n  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%",

Also,TCI\nand Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the\ncountry with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will\ndo their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the\nNHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC\nand ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime\nSportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports\ncontracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams.\n\n-PPV Mark",

        "content": "The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but\nKevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,\n7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\nLaFontaine all night.\n\nRoster move:\n\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\nscratch.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-McGill\n\nTommy Soderstrom\n\nGame Summary:\n\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\n\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\nhe was getting bored back there...\n\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\n\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\ndidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\n\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\nRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\nnext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\nend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\n\nHe's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\nfour years if there was a consensus.\n\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\n\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\nall over it.\n\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\n\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\n\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\nset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\n\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\n\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\nangles...\n\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\n\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\n\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\n\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\n\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\n\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\nthe middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.\n\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\nof the season.\n\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\n\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running \nout as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\ncorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\ngame.\n\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\n\nA couple misc notes:\n\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\n\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\n\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\n\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\nrole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t40 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tEric Lindros\t74 1992-93\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tMark Recchi\t121 1992-93*\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t52 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t121\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t84\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t62\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t59\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner",

        "subject": "SHARKS REVIEW Part 3: Defensemen (21-45)",
        "content": "#21\tPETER AHOLA\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the\nPenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been\nspectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);\nit's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\n\n#24\tDOUG WILSON\t\tSeason: 16th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\n\t\t2nd round pick in '92 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\nWilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\n\n#29\tDEAN KOLSTAD\t\tSeason:\t2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (C-/D+)\n\nIt's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\n\n#38\tPAT MACLEOD\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\nhe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\nSince he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\nskills.\n\n#41\tTOM PEDERSON\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+)\n\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\n43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\n\n#45\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D)\n\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\nwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

While the exact details are not known, it is believed\n- to concern the Oiler's future.\n-\n- Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement\n- with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,\n- Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that\n- the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\n- renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\n-\n- Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\n- but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.\n-\n- As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly\n- supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market\n- team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\n- that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\n- than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if\n- the team does move, there is no place more deserving than\n- Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand\n- realignment scheme of Bettman?\n-\n\n  Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the\nOpposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  The\ngovernment said that Pock is going nowhere!\n\n  Why don't I believe the government?  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be\nTory leader 9 years ago?\n\nDave Shariff Yadallee (B.

I don't like to see stickwork,\nbut you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move\n(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back\nof their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of\nbricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm \ntalking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the \nplayer you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid\nretaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of \nposition for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short\nside.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with\nhelpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who\nI have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays\nhuge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)\n\nBarfly",

        "content": "Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993.\nThe game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although\nI think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.\n\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\n\nTopics\n------\n\nDon's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.\n\nEpisode Summary\n---------------\n\nThis episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was\npointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,\nand Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)\n\nRon Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a\nhotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of\nall the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter\nand Fuhr.\n\nDon began to praise Fuhr, calling him the \"greatest goalie\", and\nsaid that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself.\nHe then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when\nFuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised \"Don't Trade Fuhr!\"\n\nDon went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would\nbe Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the\ntrade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.\n\nThe next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by\ntoo many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver\ngame, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.\nRon said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,\nbut Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi\nhitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: \"Its sad what\nthey're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.\"\n\nNext, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.\nPeople in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke \"Wendy\" for not fighting.\nHowever, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.\n\nThis lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how\nbanning fighting leads to more high sticking: \"It's like college\nhockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.\nThat's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you\nwon't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made\nby people who don't know what's going on in hockey\".\n\nThe final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out\nthat he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip\nof Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was\ntaught to \"play to win\", which differs from today's idea of\njust letting kids have fun.\n\nAt then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's\ncorner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like\none of the chipmunks.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some\ngood quotes.\n\nI'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \\  \\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\n    \\  \\                  |Department of Computing Science,\n     \\  \\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n      \\    ###  \\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\n       \\___###___\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

I think\nit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. \n\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\n\nTopics\n------\n\nDon's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\n\nEpisode Summary\n---------------\n\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\n\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\nwon in their building, we're going to win in ours\".\n\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\nresulting in a goal.\n\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\nthe Leaf players \"Don't let them score on you\".\n\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\ninstant replay.\n\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his\nplay.\n\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\nthat he can't play the way he should, because of the league's\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\nproblems.\n\nDon's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don't fight\nbecause they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\nwouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\n\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\nsomeone gets cut every period.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported\nby Murray.\n\nI'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.",

There wasn't exactly a radical\nshift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The\nonly real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if\nhe stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been\nquoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the\nDucks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,\nand he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder\nwhether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those\ninjuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an\nearthquake collapsed the root cellar.\n\n>Of course, Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal\n>contributions before he was fired, so it's not clear that this would have\n>been different.  Besides, they *were* marginal contributors.\n\nLet's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly\nKisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong\nobjections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do\nwith both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.\n\nImagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine\nhadn't jammed.\n\n>With or without Mullen, they weren't going to be a playoff team; what good\n>does it do them to hang onto a player who'd rather be elsewhere?  \n\nEspecially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not\nthat I'd accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply wasn't there,\nand that kind of thing can affect the team.\n\n>>An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\n>>but not kept, because of his age.

But\n>>you have to find the right balance.\n\n>Right balance for what?  That's the issue.  \n\nExactly. At the time they let Skriko go, we hadn't yet had the major injury\nbugs that killed us later. I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone\nlike Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that wasn't the choice. And since the\nchoice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the\nright choice was made for that time period.\n\n-- \n Chuq \"IMHO\" Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com\n   Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ \n  Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)\n  San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)\n   San Jose Sharks fans: sharks-request@medraut.apple.com (New seat: 127/TBD)",

Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical \nplayers for Pgh are left alone.  Ulf plays rough hockey, but only when \nother players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr.  If you want to say anyone\non the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it's Jennings or Caufield.

I got wrapped up in my own \"money\" pool\n  and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew\n  btw).  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and\n  maybe John MacLean.  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well.  Out of\n  curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my\n  amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to\n  finsh 79th!

I mean, Fleury does a pretty good\njob and isn't that large, but Dody is no Fleury. \n\nHaving been witness to three or four of his fights closeup, he simply isn't\nready to fight at an NHL level (assuming that it's his role, which is ALL he\nreally showed us in his few games up from K.C. -- if he can pass, shoot or\nskate, I never saw much of it). All he has is a right fist, which isn't bad,\nbut at the NHL level, the other players are smart enough to grab the thing\nbefore he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand, he's a\nfish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything\nhe wants to him. His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach\nuntil he found an opening -- and I never once saw him find an opening worth\ntalking about. He got neutralized quickly, and stomped on a couple of times.\n\nUnless he shows some new tricks in camp, he'll be on my \"career minor\nleaguer\" list. Since this was his first taste of the NHL, I expect the\nSharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on off-season. He\nneeds to get stronger, he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some\nversatility as something else than a simply goond, because he wasn't\nparticularly good as a goon.\n\n-- \n Chuq \"IMHO\" Von Rospach, ESD Support & Training (DAL/AUX) =+= chuq@apple.com\n   Member, SFWA =+= Editor, OtherRealms =+=  GEnie: MAC.BIGOT =+= ALink:CHUQ \n  Minor League fans: minors-request@medraut.apple.com (San Jose Giants: A/1/9)\n  San Francisco Giants fans: giants-request@medraut.apple.com (The Stick?NOT!)\n   San Jose Sharks fans: sharks-request@medraut.apple.com (New seat: 127/TBD)",

I guess since you've played a little you thereby \nqualify as an expert.  Especially since you watch all the games on t.v.  All \nthat qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato\n\n> Not that I condone violence, but I'll make an exception for Mario.\nPat Walker\n\nAgain just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are.  Truly a \nstupid statement.  Mario is definately one of the best players to play the game.\nI'm not saying he is the best to ever play the game, but he should come to\nmind when that question is asked.  Let's face it, he just returns from \nradiation therapy with around a dozen games left, overtakes Lafontaine for the\nscoring lead and then buries him!!!!  No, I guess he just got lucky.\nSpeaking of Lafontaine, now there's a guy who should be considered for the\nHart trophy as well, certainly one of the better players in the league this\nyear.",

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald\n was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy\n to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed\n on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest\n periods I've seen Sweden play this year.\n Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many\n times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\n range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,\n and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.\n\n Switzerland:\n\n Goaltender:  20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio)\n Defense:     26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger\n              16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch\n               7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter\n              31 Samuel Balmer\n Forwards:    22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger\n              23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald\n              35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle\n              15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio\n \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0)\n\n 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4:28\n      CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12:20 (pp)\n 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9:40\n      RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16:24\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic\n Attendance: 8,600\n\n Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't\n enough to win against the effective Canadians.\n\n Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just\n deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play\n goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the\n far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.\n Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of\n the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.\n Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya\n entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,\n then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to\n deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.\n The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side\n and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.\n \n Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri\n Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and\n in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,\n and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros\n after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.\n\n Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,\n 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player\n (among those Kariya with 1+6).

Washington, Abe\nLincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come\nfrom the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties,\nbut wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team\nan advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this\nyear, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about\nbeing hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an\neven bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting\nthem up.)

Daigle has\nshown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,\nand after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being\nstupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a\nrock. \n\nAlso remember that a lot of teh \"draft 1st\" stuff comes from the assumption\nhe'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that \nQuebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current\nstatus. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock\nby any means at this point.\n\nIt's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his\nsigning price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos\nsuspensions.\n\n>IMO I would\n>take Kariya.

San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards\nNiedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can\nconvince him to leave school early (which I doubt).\n\n\nMy cut on things as they stand today:\n\n>Draft Order\n>-----------\n>1) Ottawa (60% Daigle, if not, 40% Pronger)\n>2) San Jose 80% Niedermayer, unless Ottawa skips Daigle.

He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.\nIn both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres\nthe chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of\nhuge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. \nEven in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to\nindicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been\nfor Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)\nthrough the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open\nup the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on\na breakaway to salt away the game).  There\nis no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the\nvictory. \n\nIn my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as\nLaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get\nextraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev\n(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense\n, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton\nplaying a regular shift afterall ;-)\nThe difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog. \n\nGary\n\nGo Sabres!",

It's one thing to say, \"Hey, \nlet's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!\" -- that's fine. It's\nentirely another to say, \"Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town\nand move it!\" \n\nOf course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but\nfrom what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that\nthey would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000\nlevel that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he\nwas determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets\nthing as an excuse. \n\nI was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and\nthe fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the\nparking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the\nwhole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey, USA. How the\nNHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond \nme.

Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or\n>were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever\n>owned the arena doing some price gouging?\n\n\nNorman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years\nthat he has owned the team.  When he bought the team, it seemed kind of\nobvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red,\nbefore the team started making a profit again.  He gave the impression\nthat he was willing to do so.  He claimed two years ago that the team\nneeded to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit,\nbut this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket\nprices.  I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward\ntrend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in\ndeciding to move.

I admire Stewart for letting them go, but\nProbert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty?  I've never\nseen Probert whine either (he doesn't need to).

They should be the superior team.\n\nThe call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his\nstick in somebody's eye.

        "content": "From: caldwell8102@mtroyal.ab.ca\n\nNews:\n=====\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \na major part of the team. \n\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \n\nThoughts on Game 1:\n==================\n\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \n\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \n\nThoughts on Game 2:\n==================\n\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \n\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \n\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \n\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \neach other was just roughing?

Goneso in five games, and it saves\nus Caps fans a lot of pain.\n\nI mean, it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1, watching them \ntumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times\nhave they done that in their history?\n\n1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight\n1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight\n1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight\n\nIn other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they \nwere a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being \n\n1) a sweep of Philly in 1984\n2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME \nthey managed to get out of the division.\n\nActually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps\nare famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:\n\n1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,\ngave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the\nlast minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot.\nSeries tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.\n\n2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd \nperiod, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.\n\n3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.\nBlew it and the series.\n\n4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.\n\n5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.\nBlew it again.\n\nWhen they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: \"if they blew this\nlead, the series is OVER\". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders\nbelieve they can come back no matter what the score is.\n\nI am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can \ncompletely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear \nlives in a crucial game.\n\n>The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan.\n>P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh!\nWell, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps\nwere frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking \"wait\nuntil Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire\". Well, they retired (even though\nTrottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another\ngeneration of Islanders were still doing the same thing. Well, I guess \nit has nothing to do with the players.\n\n-- \n                                          Edward Lor\n                                          lor@cbnewsk.att.com",

The most logical\ntrade in the offseason to me would be between Detroit and NY Rangers.  I'm sure\nif Beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his\nroots in Detroit.  He would be a valuable asset to the Wings and Perhaps the\nRangers could get a Zombo in return?  Beezer got a few good years in him and\nthe opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play.",

        "content": "The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost\nidentical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as\nVancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2.\n\tThe pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks\nscoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave\noff a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the \nnumbers that counted: goals.\n\tVancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\n\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \n\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\nthe score 2-1. \n\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\nallowed to set up and make plays.\n\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\n\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\n\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\n\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \nbackhand even though he was off balance. \n\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\nfor their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.\n\tNext game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.\n- 30 -",

Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the\nweight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of\nmyself, and possibly others.  \n\nOh, and Ali, nice to see someone standing up for something, even if\nit's not something I personally advocate.  :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nValerie Hammerl \t       John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab \nhammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside,\nV085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.  \"I wanted to learn how to \nget that feeling, and the only way was to learn how to skate.\"  P.
