In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\nan \"air core resonant transformer\". The TV flyback version Tesla\ncoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\ndiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\n\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly\nefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\nwhich are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\nreactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\nefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\nresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\nfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\nscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\nfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\nTesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter\nand die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind\nto a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,\ngas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and\ntelegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????\n\nGET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE\nTODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!\n\nIf it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.\n(flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).\n\n----\n ET   \"Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes\".\n----",

        "content": "Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a\ncouple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\noff ;-)\n\nThanks again everyone...\n\n-=-= Wes =-=-",

Your 2F2 cap\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\nThe other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\nthe cold).\n\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\n\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\n\nCaveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\nconditions.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\n\nFor power:\n\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\n\nFor amplitude\n\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\n\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\n\nCommon references for audio are:\n\n\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\n\t0 dBV = 1 volt\n\n\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\n\t0 VU = -10dBV\t(consumer gear line level)\n\n\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\nor moment.\n\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)",

A single chip\nmicro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only\ncosts about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed\nthe whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,\nuse the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely\non the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want\nto try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut\nyou a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.\n\nIf you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of \nmaybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET\nto fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than \nyou can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add\na power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count\nscreams up to 9.\n\nPD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\nthem, So:\n\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\nthe RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more\nstable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...\nas I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new\ncapacitor will 'smooth' this out.\n\nand\n2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to\nbe placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out\nthe 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !\n\n  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH\nof a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my \ndissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not\nplaying with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long\nrun... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)\n\nEmail please....

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\nfall...\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)",

The only way \nto get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The \n\"gain\" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred \ndirection) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.\n\nBob Sciamanda\nEdinboro Univ of PA",

For one, there\nseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,\nI have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some\nrandom 50mV bias.\n\tThe other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output\nwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed\nfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input\nimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have\nmaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have\ninput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of\na pain in  the ass.\n\tIs there any way I could make myself a little box that could\nsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator\ninput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some\nlow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor\nof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd\nlike to have this box not be active.\n\tAny quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I\nhad sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it.

The stuff they will stock are the ones\nthat'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.\ni.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.\n\nThe closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or\nthe Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip\nthrough them.\n\nDistributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,\netc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where\nwe only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy\nby the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of\ndifferent non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?\nSuppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good\nbet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.\nThey also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer\nthey represent.\n\nWho knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.\nBut I'd be suprised if you do.

A continuous conductor is a good \nelectrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that need\nshielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic\nfields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,\nlike a Faraday cage.\n\nThe flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances,\nyou could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.\nYou aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be a\nreal problem (one that bit me once).",

Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring\nand tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener\nand LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever\nscheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on \nthe frontend.\n\nAlso remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm\nequivalent circuit.

This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to\nswitchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,\nas you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.\n\nAnother way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you\nlose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to\nreplace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and\nyou've got to resync the AC in no time flat.\n\nUnfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that\nAC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to\nbe usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.\n\nSimilar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back\nin the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they\ndid back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you\nit'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul\neveryone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.\n\n.",

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV\nIn order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than\nthat.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect\ninside a PC.\n\nBefore you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low\ndistortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital\nDomain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized\nwaveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on\nthe spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.\n(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed\n- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)\n\nIf you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at\nthe MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete\nsampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it\nuses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated\nfrom the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design\nguide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db\nmax (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces\n\nA evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a\ncall.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000\nfor application assistance.\n\nThis assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software.\n(Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)\n\n>I would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a Mac or PC-\n>based ADC system.\n\nI would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out\nof your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be\nthrowing out your money.\n\n>Charles Cunningham\n>cec@imager.llnl.gov\n\nK.

No current is supposed to flow in it\nunder normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in\nit either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if\nyou're grounded in some other way at the same time.  \n\nThe neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for\nthe hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you\nplug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly \nmeasure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  \n\nThey are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,\nrepeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things\nlike sub-panels.)\n\nWhat you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is \nto use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,\ndepending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.\n\nThere is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and\nnews.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and\nyou should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy\nto you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in\nthe future. \n\n\t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA\nInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055",

If\n\tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't\n\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\n\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\n\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\n\n\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\n\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\n\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\n\twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections\n\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,\n\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\n\n\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\n\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\n\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\n\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\n\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\n\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\n\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\n\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\n\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\n\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\n\trules.\n\n\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\n\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\n\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\n\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\n\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\n\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've\n\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or\n\t``CEC''.\n\n\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\n\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\n\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\n\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\n\tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\n\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\n\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the\n\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged\n\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\n\tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\n\tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the\n\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for\n\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\n\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\n\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\n\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\n\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\n\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\n\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\n\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\n\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\n\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\n\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\n\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\n\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\n\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\n\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\n\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\n\n\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\n\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\n\tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't\n\toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\n\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\n\tequivalent NEC publications.\n\n\tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\n\tthe province.\n\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\n\n\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\n\tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical\n\tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's\n\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\n\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\n\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\n\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\n\twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\n\tfind one willing to supervise.\n\n\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\n\n\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\n\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,\n\tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make\n\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\n\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\n\tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that\n\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,\n\tand will impress the inspector.\n\n\tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to\n\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\n\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.\n\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\n\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\n\n\tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.\n\n\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip\n\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\n\twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it\n\ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of\n\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\n\n\tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C\n\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\n\tbecome very brittle.\n\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\n\n\tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\n\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're \n\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\n\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\n\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\n\n\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\n\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or\n\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\n\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\n\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\n\tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even\n\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\n\n\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\n\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\n\twork well).\n\t\n\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\n\tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\n\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\n\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\n\tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should\n\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\n\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\n\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't\n\tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.\n\n\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\n\tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.\n\n\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\n\n\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\n\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire\n\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\n\taccurate.\n\n\tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\n\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\n\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\n\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\n\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip\n\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to\n\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\n\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\n\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\n\tthat you'll gouge the conductors.\n\n\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well\n\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\n\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\n\tor the insulation.\n\n\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\n\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\n\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\n\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\n\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\n\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\n\n\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\n\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\n\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\n\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known\n\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\n\n\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\n\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\n\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\n\n\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\n\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\n\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \n\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\n\tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\n\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\n\tthat has no cover plate).\n\nSubject: What is UL listing?\n\n\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\n\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\n\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\n\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\n\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\n\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily\n\tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just\n\tthat it probably won't kill you.\n\n\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\n\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\n\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\n\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\n\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\n\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\n\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\n\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\n\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\n\toccupancy permits issued.\n\t\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\n\n\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\n\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\n\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\n\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\n\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\n\trequired by law.\n\n\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\n\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\n\tclaim.\n\n\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\n\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\n\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\n\tcompanies.\n\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\n\n\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\n\n\t    Residential Wiring\n\t    by Jeff Markell,\n\t    Craftsman Books,\n\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\n\n\t    Practical Electrical Wiring\n\t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\n\t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\n\t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan\n\t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.\n\n\t    Wiring Simplified\n\t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan\n\t    Park Publishing Co.\n\t\n\tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC\n\trevision.  Which is currently 1990.\n\n\tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\n\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\n\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\n\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\n\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get\n\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\n\tquestions on the net ;-).\n\n\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\n\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\n\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\n\n\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\n\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\n\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\n\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\n\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\n\tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose\n\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\n\n\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\n\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\n\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\n\tthis.\n\n\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\n\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\n\tclaims.\n\n\tIn general, the process goes like this:\n\t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\n\t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\n\t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\n\t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not\n\t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose\n\t\t  special conditions on you, require loading\n\t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\n\t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\n\t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to\n\t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\n\t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\n\t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\n\t\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\n\t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\n\t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\n\t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\n\t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\n\t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".\n\nSubject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.\n\tDo I have to upgrade?\n\n\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\n\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\n\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\n\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you\n\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\n\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\n\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\n\n\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\n\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\n\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\n\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\n\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\n\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\n\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\n\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not\n\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\n\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\n\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\n\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\n\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\n\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\n\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\n\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\n\n\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\n\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\n\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\n\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\n\tlow.\n\n\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\n\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\n\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\n\tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.\n\n\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\n\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\n\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\n\n\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\n\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\n\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\n\n \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\n \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\n \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\n\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\n\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\n\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\n\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\n\tnormally carries no current.\n\n\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\n\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\n\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\n\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\n\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\n\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\n\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\n\n\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\n\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\n\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\n\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\n\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\n\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\n\n\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\n\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\n\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\n\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \n\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\n\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\n\tinspector.\n\n\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\n\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\n\twell.\n\n\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\n\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\n\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\n\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\n\n\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\n\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\n\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\n\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\n\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\n\tservice).\n\nSubject: What is a circuit?\n\n\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\n\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\n\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\n\t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\n\t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\n\t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\n\t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\n\n\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\n\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\n\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\n\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\n\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\n\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\n\tair conditioners.\n\n\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\n\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\n\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\n\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\n\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\n\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\n\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\n\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\n\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\n\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\n\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\n\tpermissible.]\n\n\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\n\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\n\n\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\n\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\n\n\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\n\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\n\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\n\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\n\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\n\n\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\n\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\n\n\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\n\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\n\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\n\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\n\talternative to GFCI protection.\n\nSubject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\n\n\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\n\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\n\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\n\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\n\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\n\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\n\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\n\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\n\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\n\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\n\ttogether in the panel.\n\n\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\n\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\n\n\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\n\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\n\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\n\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\n\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\n\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\n\n\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\n\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\n\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\n\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\n\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\n\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\n\tequipment itself won't cause a fire.\n\n\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\n\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\n\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\n\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\n\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\n\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\n\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\n\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\n\treplaced.\n\n\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\n\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\n\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\n\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\n\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\n\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\n\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\n\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\n\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\n\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\n\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\n\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\n\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\n\tpurpose.\n\n\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\n\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\n\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\n\tcan often cause severe damage.\n\nSubject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?\n\n\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\n\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\n\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\n\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\n\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\n\tpenny\" trick.\n\n\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\n\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\n\n\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\n\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\n\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\n\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\n\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\n\tBreakers don't do this.\n\n\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\n\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\n\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\n\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\n\n\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\n\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\n\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\n\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\n\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\n\tif you need one.\n\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\n\n\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\n\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\n\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\n\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\n\t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.\n\n\tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\n\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\n\tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate\n\theat easily:\n\n\t\tGauge\t\tAmps\n\t\t14\t\t15\n\t\t12\t\t20\n\t\t10\t\t30\n\t\t8\t\t40\n\t\t6\t\t65\n\t\n\tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\n\ton the application and precise wire type.\n\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\n\n\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\n\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\n\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\n\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\n\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\n\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\n\truns.\n\n\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\n\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\n\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\n\tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits\n\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\n\twire.\n\nSubject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\n\n\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\n\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\n\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\n\tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\n\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\n\n\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\n\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\n\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\n\n\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\n\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\n\nSubject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\n\tused?\n\n\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used\n\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\n\tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\n\n\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\n\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\n\n\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the\n\twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically\n\tsecure.\n\n\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\n\tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the\n\tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.\n\n\tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\n\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\n\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\n\tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\n\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\n\n\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\n\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\n\ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because\n\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\n\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\n\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\n\n\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures\n\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\n\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\n\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\n\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\n\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\n\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\n\tthe circuit.\n\n\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\n\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\n\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\n\twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\n\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\n\tGFCI happy.\n\n\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\n\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\n\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\n\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\n\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\n\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\n\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\n\n\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\n\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,\n\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\n\tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water\n\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\n\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',\n\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\n\tlaundry appliances.\n\n\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\n\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\n\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\n\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to\n\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\n\n\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\n\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\n\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\n\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\n\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\n\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\n\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\n\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\n\nSubject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?\n\n\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a\n\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\n\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\n\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\n\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\n\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\n\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\n\tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no\n\tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring\n\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\n\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\n\n\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\n\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\n\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\n\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\n\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\n\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\n\tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\n\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a\n\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\n\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\n\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\n\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\n\n\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\n\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\n\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.\n\n\tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one\n\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't\n\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\n\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\n\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\n\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\n\n\tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little\n\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\n\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\n\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\n\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\n\nSubject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\n\n\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,\n\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without\n\ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against\n\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\n\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an\n\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\n\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\n\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\n\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\n\tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of\n\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\n\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\n\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\n\n\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\n\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\n\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\n\telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will\n\thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;\n\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\n\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to\n\tground...\n\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\n\n\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\n\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\n\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\n\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\n\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\n\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\n\n\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\n\n\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\n\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\n\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\n\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\n\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\n\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\n\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\n\n\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\n\tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\n\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\n\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\n\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\n\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\n\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\n\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\n\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be\n\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\n\n\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\n\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\n\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\n\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\n\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\n\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\n\tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect\n\tfrom downstream outlets.\n\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\n\n\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\n\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\n\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\n\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\n\n\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\n\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\n\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\n\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\n\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\n\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\n\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\n\n\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\n\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\n\tfairly resistant to damage.\n\n\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\n\tsheath.\n\t\n\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\n\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\n\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\n\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\n\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\n\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\n\n\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\n\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\n\tbut this is technically illegal.]\n\n\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\n\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\n\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\n\tand CEC):\n\n\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\n\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\n\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\n\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\n\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\n\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\n\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\n\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\n\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\n\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\n\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\n\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\n\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\n\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\n\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box\n\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.\n\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\n\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\n\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\n\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\n\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\n\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\n\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\n\t      in the breach...]\n\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\n\t      similar finish.\n\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\n\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\n\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\n\t      than 1m (39\").\n\n\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\n\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\n\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\n\tthe insulation.\n\n\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\n\tsolid wall coverings.\n\n\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\n\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\n\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\n\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\n\twire.\n\n\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\n\n\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\n\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\n\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\n\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\n\twiring section.]\n\n \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\n \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\n \tpurpose.\n\n\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\n\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\n\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\n\tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\n\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\n\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\n\t\n \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\n \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\n \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\".\n\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\n\n\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\n\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\n\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\n\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything\n\tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.\n\n\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\n\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\n\n\tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC\n\n\tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\n\tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc.\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90\n\t\n\tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF\n\tService entrance\t\t\tRWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTWU\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90\n\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]\n\nSubject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\n\n\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\n\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\n\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\n\tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.\n\n\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\n\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\n\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\n\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\n\n\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\n\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\n\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\n\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\n\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\n\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\n\n\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\n\n\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible\n\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\n\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\n\tget nasty.\n\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\n\n\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\n\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\n\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\n\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\n\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\n\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\n\twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\n\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\n\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\n\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\n\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\n\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\n\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\n\n\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\n\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\n\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\n\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\n\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\n\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\n\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\n\tmounted between the joists.\n\n\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\n\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\n\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\n\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\n\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\n\t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\n\twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*\n\tlong)\n\n\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\n\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\n\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\n\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.\n\tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't\n\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\n\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get\n\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\n\tin later.]\n\n\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\n\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\n\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\n\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\n\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\n\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\n\tfor the sensor can vary.\n\n\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\n\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.\n\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\n\n\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\n\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\n\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\n\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\n\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\n\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\n\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\n\n\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\n\tand have them come and check out the problem.\n\n\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\n\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\n\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\n\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\n\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\n\n\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\n\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\n\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\n\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\n\n\tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\n\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\n\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\n\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\n\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\n\n\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\n\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\n\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\n\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\n\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\n\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\n\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\n\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\n\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an\n\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\n\n\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\n\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\n\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\n\n\tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there\n\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\n\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\n\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\n\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\n\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\n\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\n\n\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\n\tthan 50 feet long.\n\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\n\n\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\n\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\n\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\n\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\n\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\n\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\n\n\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\n\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\n\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\n\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\n\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\n\tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that\n\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\n\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far\n\tmore current than it can continuously.\n\n\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\n\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,\n\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\n\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\n\n\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\n\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\n\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\n\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\n\n\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\n\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\n\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\n\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\n\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\n\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\n\t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can\n\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\n\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\n\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\n\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\n\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\n\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\n\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\n\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\n\t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\n\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\n\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't\n\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\n\t       on BX cable.\n\n\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\n\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\n\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\n\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\n\tShould the test button work?\n\n\tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\n\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's\n\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\n\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\n\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\n\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require\n\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\n\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\n\tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially\n\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\n\n\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\n\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\n\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\n\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\n\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\n\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\n\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\n\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\n\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\n\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\n\tit, and promised to investigate.)\n\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\n\n\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\n\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\n\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\n\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\n\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\n\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\n\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\n\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\n\twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\n\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\n\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\n\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\n\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\n\tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\n\n\tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the\n\tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.\n\tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\n\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\n\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\n\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\n\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\n\twrong.\n\n\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\n\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\n\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\n\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\n\n\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\n\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\n\tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you\n\tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled\n\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\n\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much\n\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\n\n\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\n\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\n\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\n\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\n\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe''\n\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\n\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\n\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\n\t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.\n\n\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\n\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\n\teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop\n\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\n\thave a different idea.\n\n\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\n\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\n\nSubject: Underground Wiring\n\n\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\n\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\n\ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots\n\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\n\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\n\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\n\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\n\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\n\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\n\tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.\n\n\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\n\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\n\tyour specific situation.\n\n\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\n\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\n\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\n\n\tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\n\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\n\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\n\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\n\tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new\n\twiring.\n\n\tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\n\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\n\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\n\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\n\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\n\n\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\n\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\n\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\n\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\n\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\n\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\n\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\n\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\n\tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even\n\tcause a fire.\n\n\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\n\tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of\n\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing\n\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\n\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\n\tfor the following things:\n\n\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\n\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\n\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\n\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\n\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\n\n\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\n\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\n\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\n\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\n\t       up each connection.\n\n\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\n\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\n\n\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\n\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\n\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\n\n\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\n\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\n\t       be repaired.\n\t    \n\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\n\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\n\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\n\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\n\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\n\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\n\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\n\t       you can rent the tool.\n\n\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\n\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\n\t    \n\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\n\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\n    \n\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\n\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\n\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\n\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\n\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\n\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\n\tYou can do this yourself too.\n\nSubject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?\n\n\tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire\n\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\n\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\n\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\n\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\n\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\n\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\n\n\tHere's some hints on what to look for:\n\n\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\n\n\t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\n\t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\n\t\t  proper marking.\n\t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\n\t\t  a GFCI)\n\t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\n\t\t- Switched neutrals\n\t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\n\n\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\n\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\n\n\t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\n\t\t   not properly terminated wiring)\n\t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\n\t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\n\t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-)\n\t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\n\t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\n\t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\n\t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\n\t\t  ceiling\n\t\t- Backwrapped grounding wires\n\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\n\t\n\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\n\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\n\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \n\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\n\n\tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called\n\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\n\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\n\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\n\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\n\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\n\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\n\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\n\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\n\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\n\tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\n\tcolour as the hot wires.\n\n\tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.\n\n\tComments on K&T:\n\n\t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\n\t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\n\t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\n\t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in\n\t\t  quite good condition.\n\t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\n\t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\n\t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\n\t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\n\t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between\n\t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\n\t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\n\t\t  any circuit.\n\t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\n\t\t  that contain K&T.\n\t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\n\t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\n\t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\n\t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\n\t\n\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't\n\tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should\n\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\n\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly\n\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\n\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\n\t\n\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\n\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\n\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\n\tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.\n\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\n\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole\n\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\n\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\n\n\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\n\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\n\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\n\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\n\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\n\ttubing.\n\n\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\n\tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\n\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard\n\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\n\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\n\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.\n\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\n\n\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\n\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\n\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\n\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\n\tknow what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable\n\tsales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.\n-- \nChris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541\nPsroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca\nFerret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca",

Is this true?\n\nI own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no\n  amp which can touch it at the price range.\nThe build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other \n  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid\n  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.\nIf you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components \n  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect\n  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each\n  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\n\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\n  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components\n  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the\n  amplifiers sound so brilliant.\nI cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with\n  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly\n  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.\n\nMy last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like\n  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded\n  like new.\n\nIf you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will\n  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.\n\nJust my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.\n\n--\n***********************************************************************\n**    Alan Webber                                                    **\n**                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                                                                   **\n** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **\n** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **\n** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **\n** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    **\n***********************************************************************",

There are two precision levels, one  \nfor army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil  \nones. The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),  \nthough, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings.

Because You never get all thermic energy out of  \nthe powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  \nof the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  \noil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  \nthe turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  \nsteam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  \nsomething else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  \ntype of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  \nunobjectionable).

I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets,\nrather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup\nin long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.\n\nGFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them\nregularly (using the test button).\n\nRunning the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I\nhave seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check\ntheir common sense list.

They are essentially\ndouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.\nThe receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used\npreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham\nRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.\n\n  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used\nat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\n\n  While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on\nreceive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I\ndidn't bother with it.\n\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data\nstream is another matter entirely.\n\n  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\n\"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow\ndue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO\nalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even\nthough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes\nof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of\na second.\n\n  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in\nand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland\nIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the\nproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running\nlow on resources of time, money and energy.\n\n  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW\nID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma\nMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally\npolarized.\n\n  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly\napproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and\nyou might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can't\narrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think\nyou'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by\nmultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.\nFor more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread\nspectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.\nI'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.\n\n73\nGlenn Elmore n6gn\n\nN6GN @ K3MC      \namateur IP:\tglenn@SantaRosa.ampr.org\nInternet:\tglenne@sr.hp.com",

We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment \nall day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along\nwith PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name\na few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long\nas you adhere to sound engineering practices.  \n\nA good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design\nHandbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered\nto be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.\n\nThe very fact that you need to build a test fixture means\nyou're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself\nhas far more inductance per pin than the package you are\ntesting, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I\ndon't see the big concern over the packaging because it\nprobably isn't going to make that much difference\n\nIf you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...\nTTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.\n:-(\n\naaron\n\nP.S.

If you take off from the center and ground legs of\nthe volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably \nbefore the other controls).  \n\nIf the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should\nprobably forget the whole thing. \n\n\t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA\nInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055",

The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by \n1/4, then 1/8 etc.\n\nAs for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct \nlength for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the \nwavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR \nin using the middle channel of those you are going to use.\nAnyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in, \nnowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not \nmuch point in SWRing.

They look like cylinders\n>that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the\n>actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they're called\n>'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?\n\nExcept for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants\nare vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling\ntowers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for\ncoal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.\n\nBasicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when\nits air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network\nof pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\nhot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than\njust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is\nrapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently\nseen rising out of these towers.\n\nThat slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because\nit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of\nthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.\n\nThe towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam\nsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the\nboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across\nthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and\nby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it\nback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference\n(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \"hot\"\nturbine to final stage \"cold\" turbine).\n\n                                        R.

        "subject": "Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring",
        "content": "There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\n\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\nconductor.  \n\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \n\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \n\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \n\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\npresent a shock hazard.  \n\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\n\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \n\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\n\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \n(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not\nit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\n\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\n\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\nit's primarily for lightning protection.\n\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\naluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \n\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\ngreenfield.\n\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\n\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\nGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be\nrenumbered though.) \n\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \n\nJohn\n-- \n*******************************************************************************\nJohn H.

Several\npeople responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated \nexactly what I am looking for.\n\tI'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host\nvia RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require\nabout 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots\nof people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be\ninterfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it \nwould be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use\nan 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then \ntransfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM\nneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes\nto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).\nEverything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for\nthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART\nbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a \ncompany that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain \ncircuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.\n\nRich",

(There's a gripe in the industry\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \n\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \npollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \n\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\nthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \ncooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Nagle",

That is, it's okay to experiment with\na patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your\nstereo), even if it's only your own private practical use.\n\nOf course, it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detected\nor that you will ever be sued over it.\n-- \nAll work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry",

It's not fully\nup to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different\nmanufacturer's synonyms):\n\n------\nIn practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view\nof the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my\nviews on things like availability and backward compatibility):\n\n74\tThe original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively\n\tobsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball\n\tfunctions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.\n\n74H\tModification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher\n\tpower consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74L\tModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.\n\tVery obsolete; use CMOS.\n\n74S\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\n\tpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74LS\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\n\tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\n\tdevices.\n\n74F\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\n\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\n\n74AS\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\n\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\n\n74ALS\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\n\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\n\n74C\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\n\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\n\tCMOS 74 families.\n\n4000\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\n\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\n\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\n\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\n\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\n\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\n\tclear choice when speed is not important.\n\n74HC\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\n\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\n\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\n\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\n\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\n\tconsumption at faster speeds.\n\n74HCT\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\n\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\n\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\n\n10K\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\n\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\n\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\n\tthe rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\n\tcan be expensive.\n\n100K\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\n\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\n\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\n\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\ninteresting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\n-- \nAll work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry",

However, if you use the method of \ncopying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to \nthe protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the \nprotection.\n\nOne thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape \nfor viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an \nextra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR \nfirst, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I \ndon't know if they would react or not.

OK ?\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\n         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry \n         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-\n         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find\n         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \n         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"\n         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\n         energy that carnot will give them.\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\n         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\n         \n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with\n         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\n         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \n\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have\n         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and\n         getting children with 2 heads.

If the ground connections on the outlets are\nconnected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the\nmain panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground\nrod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of\nthe goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot\nto the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.  \n\nHmmm.

As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many\n>>fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive\n>>contamination.\n\nActually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are\n1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than\nnuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many\nfossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\nadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\").  \n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\n\n>       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual \n>boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\n>rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \n>pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \n\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\nnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \n\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\ncosts.  \n\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\ncondenser area.\n\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\n\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\npressure.\n\n>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and\nfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard \nstepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.\nThe plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood\nthe costs of impure water.  By \"impure\", I mean water with a few\ndozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved\noxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will \nfind outside the laboratory.\n\nJohn\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?",

Apparently land-based\n>beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS \n>receiver (with differential option installed).\n\n>How does this system work?  What frequency is used for\n>the land-based beacons?\n\n>Thanks in advance,\n\n>Charlie Thompson\n>.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\nunit.\n\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\nwhich has stations all across the US.\n\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn P.

In our case, other\nmonitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be\nspecific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this\nproblem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc\nseveral 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the\njuice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side\nof wall maybe?\nWe started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input\nlines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference\neffect on the computer monitor next to it. \nNow on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very\ncommon, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type\nO'scopes).\nI talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount\naround deflection coil of interfering monitor. \nBE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH\nVOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T\nBLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO\nMOUNT CAN.\nNow, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also\ngood at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on\nmonitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other\nsources.\n\nJeff Babb\nbabb@sciences.sdsu.edu   babb@ucssun1.sdsu.edu\nProgrammer, SDSU - LARC",

If you have an idea about its voltage and current \nratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with \nanything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating \nof approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely \"ON\" \nat +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or \nless voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is \nused as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to \nexperiment with various gain-altering techniques.\n\nBill Willis     willisw@coe-nw.clemson.edu\n(803) 656-5550",

When I look at the spectrum using an\nHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to \n'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the \ninput since it will read accurately down to DC.\n\nAlso, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, \nhow important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected \nto the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused \nby different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for \nuse with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I would\nappreciate it.",

It is very unlikely, however,\nthat a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\nfor cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\nradio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \naway.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\nIf you experience the problem frequently, it may be \ncaused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\nnearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \ntransmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\netc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\ncorrect in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\nIf you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\nchokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\nbeing picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\nbe installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\nGood instructions are included with the chokes.\nIf that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\nneighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\nor car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\na radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\n-- \n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nRandall Rhea                                        Informix Software, Inc. \nProject Manager, MIS Sales/Marketing Systems    uunet!pyramid!infmx!randall",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd\nlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to\nuse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation\nconsoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.\n\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\n\nI've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\ncuetape!)\n\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\nof some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured\nout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMark Fontana\n\n-- \n \"Of all the arts, the cinema is  |  Mark A.

        "content": "I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.\na blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics\ncard.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\ncheap.  \n\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\n\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\ncircuit would not detect it.   \n\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\nvideo signals to make this work.  \n\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \nsplit supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator\nwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply\ncircuit.  \n\nAt this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor\ncircuit.

It is very unlikely, however,\n   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\n\nNot possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for\njust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\ndown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\n\n   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \ncause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \n\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\nToo bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers\nto take any precautions.\n\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\nthan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\nCB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nDouglas S.

Both produce very good output,\nbut you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet\noutput is definitely superior.  \n\nOn the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use\nthe cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much\nworse than a bubblejet. :-)\n\nOne other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets.\nThere are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output\n(such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really good\nlooking output (such as HP's DeskJets).  IBM and Canon both produce some of\nthe really good style bubblejets.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad\n\nP.S. -- If you're in the market for a portable bublejet printer, I can\nhighly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet, although I've heard the portable\nCanons are good too (I needed PCL support, myself).

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and\nOberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a\nspot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,\nthe detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the\nfour sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of\nthe crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional\nto the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII\ngraphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)\n\n\n\n              -------------------------> 1\n             |                       |\n             |                       |       |\\\n           -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\\n           XXXXX                     ________| +  \\\n           XXXXX|                            |      \\        -------\n    light >XXXXX|                            |        \\_____ divider __ output\n           XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------\n           XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |\n           XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2\n           XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /\n           XXXXX|         \\ /        |       |/\n           XXXXX| anode              |\n           XXXXX                     |\n           ----- cathode 2           |\n             |                       |\n             |                       |\n             --------------------------> 2\n\nIf the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position\nof the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-\ntion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).

Stronger sources are\ngoing to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as\nfluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV\nsources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The\nshorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.\n\nIt wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes\nin a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively\ncheap way to create a portable source.

Strictly,\na 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change\nstate, according to the inputs.\n\nA demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which\nof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are\nthree inputs required.\n\nA decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable\ninput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all\noutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output\nwill be low).\n\nAn eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to\nselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\n\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\nfour enable lines.\n\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\nfour final stage decoders.\n\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

One ground goes to the ground pin\nof the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's\nmounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal\nfaceplate, if any).\n\nThe box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.\nThe outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated\nbusbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to\nthe building-entrance main ground by its own wire.\n\nSo the two separate ground systems are connected together at the\nbuilding's service entrance.  But one is also connected to every\ngrounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,\nwhile the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged\ninto isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens\nto accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,\nthe main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it\nuntil the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated\nground will remain relatively noise-free.",

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically\nmodified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600\nmight have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight\nof the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.\n\nAdditionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for\ntheir games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I\nwould hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking\nwith the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the\n2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).\nAlso I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into\na RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to\nbackup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could\nbe bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them\ninto a special RAM cartidge, and play them.\n\nAnyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got\ntwo 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa\ncartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and\nhandling. Don't play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo\n(interested in that too?).\n\nHope that helps your question... I might grab some 6502's out too,\nsince they must be fun to play with (as microcontrollers).\n-shishin \"squish\" yamada\nsquish@endor.harvard.edu",

Recall also that laser printers\noffer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1\nppm for an ink jet printer.\n\nSomething else to think about is the cost of consumables over the\nlife of the printer.

When I asked, people said that the\ninterpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more\ncomplicated.\n\nAnyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\"\nsampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\nantialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling\nlets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher\noversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of\nall other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should\nallow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias\nfiltering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad",

I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company\nname.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power,\nmamamia, that's pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a\n1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals.\nIf you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the\npertinent info.\n\n\tNow, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida.\nPhone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like \nnice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices,\nso they might be able to help you out.\n\n\tI'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying.\nThe device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'd\nneed to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz......\n\nDuane",

        "content": ">Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators I've been seeing\n>all over late-night TV recently? I was wondering if they use forced air, hea\n>or both. If there's heat involved, anybody know what temperature they run at\n>My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay >$100.00 for a box, a fan\n>and a heater. Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together\n>for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?\n\nYou can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, \"The\nHungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food,\" by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\nspaced every 6\" starting about 10\" above the bulb.\n\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\nfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it\noften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are\nusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway\nthrough.\n\nIf you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub\nfor this stuff.\n\ngerald.belton@ozonehole.com\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.\n                       \n----\nThe Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-3142\n3 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 Files\nSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet Newsgroups\nPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com",

        "content": "I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that\nsomething similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently\ndon't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing\ncameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests\nare going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the\nvideo being piped into a command center they're building\nsomewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or\ncheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large\nmulti-colored status displays will show the various routes\nusing different colors to represent the various average speeds\nfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front\nof the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic\nstatus to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also\nlooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to\nproviding continuous audio from this system.\n\nIn the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display\nboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data\non traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the\nsystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it\nwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is\nsimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read\n\"cheap\").\n\nWe also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP\naudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal\nreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle\nreceivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is\napplicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some\nother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\ndon't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You\nmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing\nmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)\n\nI think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more\ninfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.\n\nCheers,\nAlan\n<acooney@netcom.com>",

The filtering is not\ninterpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal\nyou are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an\nall-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's\nheart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks\nthat weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the\nproperly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at\nthat point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not\nunreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things\nin realtime if you write efficient code.\n\nIn case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)\nfilter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out\nthere know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with\nresistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as\nthe most cost effective method for volume production runs.\n\n\n>Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\"\n>sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\n>antialiasing filters.

I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to\nfilter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and\ngive the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they\ncharge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.\n\nI seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.

GANDLER) writes:\n>\n>\tHow does the radio Electronics free information cards work.\n>Do they just send you some general information about the companies that\n>advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a\n>catalog. \n\nThat depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\ndata on computer disk.\n\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\n\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.\n\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\nthe serious potential customers.\n\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\n\nWhat's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\n\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\n  weeks later.\n\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\n  on a computer printout.\n\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\n\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.\n  Advertisers almost never call. \n\nJohn Schuch\n  publisher of: The Arizona High-Tech Times\n                The Arizona Electrical Journal\n                The Arizona HVAC News\n  (all of which have bingo cards)",

If you want to protect you soft, supply a\n>good documentation and support. This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively \n>protecting software.\n\nThere are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the\nuser is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is\nfor the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on\n(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different\nmachine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  \n\nThe program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends\non the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user \ndid an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.\nNo document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!\n\nI did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's \nconscience should do that.\n\nI know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of \"casual\"\nusers who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights\n(It's the truth.  I have \"friends\" who ask me for copies of my latest games\nall the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casual\npirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection will\ndiscourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my \"friends\" dug up\nsomewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actual\nrelease!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable\nthe quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determined\npirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread \nthat far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once\nfound by authorities.  It is the \"casual\" pirates that the copy protection is\ndetermined to discourage.\n\nWhat I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus\na special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup\n\"REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip\" and disables the above.\nTwo benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and\nmakes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is\nencrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a\nstable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus\nviolated their license agreement.\n\nThis way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal \ndiscomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only\nproblem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.\n\nThe registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore\ngains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,\nthe software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is \nsupposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not \nsupposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,\na hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?\n\n--Kasey Chang",

Also, make sure that your\nprogram can not be run out a debugger.\n\nAnother method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk,\njust write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here,\nyou also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.\nMake sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with\ngarbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in\nsome random sector.\n\nLike you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they\nare both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the\nopposite of what you want.\n\nAnother configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the\nmachine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can\nthink of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, it\nrequests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk should\nbe encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything\nelse you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Once\nagain, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC\nchecks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among other\nthings, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects a\nchange in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the\nprogram.  Tell them the program is \"VIRUS SECURE\", and remember, you have\nhelped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.\n\nI hope that I have helped.  Have fun.  Knock some cracking out (well, you can't\ndo it, everything that can be written can be cracked, but you'll piss'em off in\nthe process!).

Carpenter) writes:\n>\n>> I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the\n>> distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?\n>\n>Yes. It's called RADAR.\nWell, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances\nby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its\nreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters\nuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of\nthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,\nthe original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500\nfeet altitude.\n\nNote, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster\noriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between\na transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate\ntime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter\ntriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually\ntravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference\nis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a\ncommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something\nlike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both\nthe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,\nbut plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.\n\nWhy not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again\nthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.\nshould know about anyway ;-).\n\n>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength\n>> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),\n>> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.\n\nThis is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter\nvaries from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission\nline, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit\nover time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With\nthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at\none place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for\nthe R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...\n\n>Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in\n>a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this\n>concept.\n\nNope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless\nthe two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.\nThis is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.\nSignals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...\n\n>> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?\n\nAs high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance\nattenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies\naround 4 GHz.\n\nHope this helps...\n\n-- \n==========================================================\nJack Brindle\nham radio: wa4fib\ninternet: jackb@mdd.comm.mot.com",

The copy\nprotection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode,\ncompressed executables, progs that load and execute other progs (possibly\ncompressed), dongles, key disks, etc...\n\nI believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection\nschemes.\n\n>--\n> Michael Chen\t\t\t| From the depths of our most lucid horrors |\n>\t\t\t\t| spring our fond hopes and pure desires... |\n> mchen@cs.psu.edu\t\t| except what comes from HELL! :-) 7/23/92  |\n\n\n-- \nAlex T.

I personally am concerned only with a small lab  \nwith ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with  \nadmin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  \nthan a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of  \nyour program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.   \n\"Pirate board\" or no pirate board.  I too have \"friends\" who blatantly and  \nquite successfuly \"hack\" copy protection schemes practically in their  \nsleep.\n\nLet's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one  \nmachine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some  \nsetting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,  \nmostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network  \nadministrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  \n(partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and \"acting\" similar to  \nthe average user, and maintaining \"behind-the-scenes\" consistency is a  \nreal headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  \ndifferent folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  \ndisk.\n\nOften we have hardware problems at peak \"business\" times and have to do  \nsome parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .\n\nWell, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..\n\nThe point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration  \nfiles etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found  \nto do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  \nCOPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  \nmachine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  \nten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  \nthis considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  \nall network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.\n\nOften, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  \nto one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  \nusually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  \nthe original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with \"copy  \nprotection\" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  \n . .\n\nIn short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort  \nof like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and  \nyou will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's  \nguide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this  \nREGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute  \nthe manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but  \nplease take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the  \ncosts of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the  \nlegitimate user with a \"copy protection\" scheme!\n\n\nSorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . .. :-)\n\n\nMark S.

In storage,\neither the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chance\nI'd ever do that at home), or the battery should be stored on a trickle\ncharge.  I have also (I think) read that the condition may be reversable\nif hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time.\nThe refernce I remember is to use C/50 (where C is the amp hours) as the\ncharging circuit, and leave it hooked up for weeks.  Some of this may\nonly apply to Gel type cells, but I suspect the same applies to the liquid\ntype.\n\nRichard Dell",

To get an image on the screen, you had to wait\nuntil the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line\ninto the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many\nduplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. This\ntook all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the\ndisplay.\n\n>There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage\n>regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.\n\nThe RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page\n1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is\nboth shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a\nmachine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it\nalso wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the\nhigh byte of the address is hardwired to 1).\n\nThe IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers\n(can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the\n6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I\nthink this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so\nmany games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do\nsomething else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.\n\nThere was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at\nleast 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I\nimagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly\nto chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so\nthe 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly\nnormal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more\nusual active low chip select.\n\nJohn West",

Also, exact part\n|> numbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!\n\nThe first step is to make sure that there is no DC component, intentional\nor not, on the audio lines to be switched. If neither the output or\ninput presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively\ncoupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and\nfrom the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any\ncoupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.\n\nIf the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than\njust coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before\nswitching with coupling capacitors of your own.\n\nIf you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input\nthrough to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching\nwhere for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch\nchange. This may mask the switch click.\n\nAn audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and\nmaking your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)\nsealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles\nuse this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes\na complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.\nRadio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.\n\nFor a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try \nlooking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its\nolder predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed\nprior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete\nand IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).\nAll the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily\nmake a subject for a multi-page article.\n\nSolid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on\ndue to charge being injected into the audio line through device\ncapacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to\nminimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through\nthe switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the\ncontrol pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as\nputting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.\n\nHope this helps at least get you started.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)",

Making it\nplainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates. But, the\ndetermined ones are just going to answer \"Joe Blow\" to the question of\n\"what's your name\" so this won't stop them in the long run.\n\n\tPirates are always going to win this fight.

Most boards today are fiberglass, the type being chosen\nby its use and cost.  \n\nBoards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon (and ceramic) as the\nfiberglass, and other boards are conductive (they actually work more as a \ncapacitive dialectric, but the word conductive simplifies explaination) at the\nhigh frequencies.\n\nAnother printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections\nis a thin flexible (mostly mylar) material and is used to connect the front of\nthe vehicle (etc) to the back instead of wiring harnesses.  Camcorders use this\nto intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance.\n\nAm working on a generator made by Hewlet Packard right now and the entire board\nis gold plated, boy it looks expensive!!!\n\nHope I got most of my facts right as I am working from memory of material read.\n\nMy education was pre-transister!\n-- \n73, Tom\n================================================================================\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

You see, dirt has good karma,\nsince it's all organic and full of living things, but cement is all squared\noff and artificial looking, and has lost its karma in the process.  Being\na karma sink, it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no\nlonger able to keep a charge.

Load the game images into the EEPROM at $2000, $4000, etc. (Your EEPROM\nburner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into\none file yourself with suitable gaps.)\n2. Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game\nconsole, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games.\n\nTo directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address'\nis simply another address line.\n\nFor a concrete example, with the 27C512 and 8K games images, you would\nwire A0-A12 to the cartridge, and A13-A15 to 3 switches.

The transformer is just that - a \ntransformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although\nthe inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT\nnegligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to\nget one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a\n\"snubber\" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended\nfor switcher use today have the diode built in.)\n\nThe basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in\na somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a\nhigh voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or\n\"filter\") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.\nThe transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,\nresulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which \nare then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs\nis sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,\nwhich acts in a \"pulse-width modulation\" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying\nthe pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and\ntherefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs\nmay be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less\ntracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear\nregulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the \nregulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)\nis not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various\nsafety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be\nelectrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator\nto meet this requirement.\n\nWhile the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these\ndesigns, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can\nbe ignored; besides the inductive \"kick\" giving the switch transistor a\nbad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the\nenergy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.\nIn some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,\nyou need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't\nsaturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the \nimagination! :-)).\n\nI'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; \nhopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors\nin the above.\n\n\nBob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not\n                   Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any other\nmyers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.",

The problem is that lead-acid\ncells self discharge over time. Even high quality cells (Gates for instance)\nwill discharge 50-60% over a 3-5 month period of time. Non-sealed cells\nself discharge even faster.

Furthermore it is very silly to \nstore the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to \ncontact the ballast. \n\nSeriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary \ngreatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in \nfact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full \ncharge for > 2 years so it must be possible.\n\nIf your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above \nfreezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a \nmonth?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, \nDON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).\n\nAnouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like \nelectric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep \ndischarged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance \nautomotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure \nshortly afterwards but modern ones are superb.

First of all, anyone\nwith a DOS manual can copy a disk, or copy anything (hidden files dont\ngo far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely DOS ignorant) off\nof a hard disk.

In my experience with the world of\npeople and software, it seems that a good majority of people (say 80%) will\nat some point copy a friend's program (\"Gee, you really oughta try this\") or\naccept a copy.

(I.e., run by microcontrollers?)  The\neasiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the\nboards is talking to the PC.  When this line was true, the other boards\ncould all hold off and not send their data.  This isn't a perfect solution,\nthough, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't\ndecide to talk at the _exact same time_.\n\nOther than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to \"something\"\nthat speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it\nused to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPS\nor slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex\nthe data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first\nparagraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more\nthan 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to be\nable to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)\n\nYou might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC,\nthough.  I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports, 4\nRS-232 ports) for a very reasonable $85.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad",

It\nhas long blades (like fan blades in a tturbo engine on a jet is\nthe only way I can describe it.  The dead fan is ETRI Model 126LH.\nActually it's not dead, it just makes a hideous rattle noise so\nit's stealthy qualities are void.  Thanks.",

Note, though, that\nyou won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it\nmay be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.\n\nThe things are easy to dismantle.

So no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  It's\nstandard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.\n\nAll the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables\nis rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,\nand throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in\nanother.

        "content": "I thought the first thread was hilarious, so here goes another post.\n\nSome more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.\n\n  One year, I left the batteries in the garage.  The garage is Unheated.  \nThey were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding\nlawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the \nriding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries \nwas new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered\nthat all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all\nworked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced \nabout halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored\nin the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)\n  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.\none is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and\ndiscovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries\ndead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said \"HMMMMMMMM\" and \nthe amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)\nthe internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They\nwere the same.  \n   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead\nacid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only\nneeded a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them\nby using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they\nworked fine for around 25 of 'em. \n  This leads me to believe one of several things.\n     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)\n     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the\n        batteries.\n     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the \n          room where the concrete is, \n     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air\n         better than concrete.\n\n(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)  \n\n   Any other ideas?\n    *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*",

You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object\n(your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings.  In the case\nof an object with no significant internal heat production, this will\naffect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if\nit started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final\ntemperature.\n\nFor the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not\nwhether water will freeze.\n-- \nSVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\nbetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry",

Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whose\nbandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20\nkHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide). \n\nWhite noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant\nbandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whose\nbandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as \"1/3\noctave\" or \"1/2 octave\" or some such terminology).\n\nWhite noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies\n(at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise,\nhas more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3\ndb/octave).\n\n-- \n|                Dick Pierce                |\n|    Loudspeaker and Software Consulting    |\n| 17 Sartelle Street   Pepperell, MA  01463 |\n|       (508) 433-9183 (Voice and FAX)      |",

However the cable company *is required* to\nat least check out every complaint of leakage.  They must file\nwith the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement\nreport that details the results of leakage testing.\n\nBut remember, call the cable company first, and give them a\nchance to work to correct the problem before contacting\nthe commission.\n\nI am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via\nthe airborne method.\n\n-- \nSCOTTCR@WKUVX1.BITNET aka Chris Scott- \n                 Telco: (502) 745-3834",

Since pink noise is believed\nto be due to surface states (say, the surface of the Silicon where there's\na lack of a covalent bond) that act as \"traps\" to nearby elecrons, and since\nthis happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren't\nable to \"trap\" electrons), how do you compensate for that?  It seems to me\nthat you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise.  I have seen the\n\"pink noise\" feature, however, on many EQs, and I was wondering\nhow they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to\n\"man made noise\" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc.  If you have\nany information about this, it would be appreciated.

The voltage can only\nbe sucked down so far instantaneously. When you try to jumpstart someones \ncar, when your vehicle is at idle, does your car stall? No, the other car\njust does not crank well.  Now, the engine might stall because the idle\nwas too low to start with. When the extra current is drawn, the idle speed\nwill drop - as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the\nincreased amperage requirement.\n\n: >Is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company, the fcc, or both?\n: \n: Ultimately it's likely to be your problem to resolve, I'm afraid.

If surges are\noccurring there, it is due to another cause - not a transmitter.\n\n: Unfortunately, there's a fair chance that enough signal is being picked\n: up by your house wiring that a simple service-panel filter won't\n: suffice.  You may need to install heavy-duty RFI filters at the power\n: connections of your affected equipment.\n\nIt is probably not that much of a problem. Often - toroid coils on the\npower leads will solve that part of the interference problem. It will\nnot solve internal equipment deficiencies.\n\n: If the problem occurs regularly, you may need to \"stake out\" the street\n: in question, and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by\n: at the time interference occurs.  If you can identify the vehicle which\n: is transmitting, you may be able to contact its owner and complain.\n\nIt is probably not the transmitter that is at fault.

        "content": "Just thought I would add $0.02 to DeskJet thread. I got my\nfirst one in college about 5 or so years ago.\n\n\tI've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for\npast 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I\ngot software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister\nand father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go\nfor one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's).\nThe original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would\nsay that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one\n(small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.\n\n\tMy brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it\nto him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief\nadvantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:\n\nAdvantages:\tQuick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's\nprinting), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't,\nso look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet\nAppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one\nDW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to\ncolor or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I\nreceived many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp\nlaser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those\nImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25\nper sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all\nhours of the night....)\n\nDisadvantages.\tInk used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and\nwasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink\n(I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and\nrunning (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your\nbookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts\n(I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to\n$12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but\nI don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of\nabout 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after\nfooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing\ndoesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the\npaper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine.\nOther disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in\nspeed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press\nsoftware solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but\nthey won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.\n\nIn the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript\n(unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even\nwhen soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only\ninstance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board\nTransparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser\nPostscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB\nnegatives directly onto a transparency.\n\nWell, hope my babbling has helped.\n-squish@endor.harvard.edu",

They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in\nquantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info\nabout simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest\nMims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with\nresistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math\nto get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a\n555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate\ndoing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz\nto about 500 KHz (I think).\n\nAbout the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to\nuse one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio\nline (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise.\n\nThe data line is probably most easily done\nby some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565\nchip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing\nabout how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp\ninformation can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack\ninfo-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with.\nSetting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I\nwould suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is\ngoing into, so I am really generalizing...\n\nAs for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I\nsuggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would\nbe the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making.\nHope that clears things......\n\n-squish@endor.harvard.edu",

(I am almost\nsure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be\nwrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel\nlike thinking through it right now.)\n \nWhat is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,\nis exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes\n(acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals\nmay form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.\nThe reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery\ncharger) is put back into the battery.\n \nLead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each\ncell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts\n(terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric\nenergy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it\nhas a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So\nwhile keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.\n \nTo understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on\nconcrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's\nPrinciple, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will\nact to move to a more comfortable position.  Here are the thermal conductivities\nof a some selected materials:\n \n                                              thermal conductivity\n       material           Temperature, C (F)  BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft)\n       --------           ------------------  --------------------\ndiatomaceous earth,            204                   0.051\n natural, across strata        871                   0.077\ndiatomaceous, natural,         204                   0.081\n parallel to strata            871                   0.106\ndiatomaceous earth powder     (100)                  0.039\n  (density, 18 lb/cu.ft)      (200)                  0.042\n                              (300)                  0.044\n                              (400)                  0.048\n                              (500)                  0.051\nconcrete (cinder)              ---                   0.20\n         (stone)               ---                   0.54\n         (1:4 dry)             ---                   0.44\npine (across grain)             15                   0.087\n   (parallel to grain)          21                   0.20\noak (across grain)              15                   0.12\nmaple (across grain)            50                   0.11\n \nNote that the thermal conductivity for \"dirt\" (diatomaceous earth) goes down\nwith temperature.  Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder\nare on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivity\nof concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4\ntimes greater than wood.\n \nIt is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on\nconcrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the\ndischarge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity\nor heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).)\nDuring storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on\nthe battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity\nsurface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity\nsurface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom\nsurface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,\nthe battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster\nthan that on dirt.\n \nThis is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play.  Removing energy from\nthe exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the\nreaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that\ntemperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is\na better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner\nof a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which\n\"pulls\" the reaction along.\n \nAlso, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric\nacid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.\n \nJeff White      jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu\n \n\"How do I get the ketchup out of my pocket protector?\"  French fries!",

In the event of a total\nhard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data\nfrom the backups I keep of that.  With upwards of 100Mb of stuff on my hard\ndisk, there is no way I'm going to try and back it all up without a tape\ndrive. :)  Would be nice to have one though!\n\n> RAM is something you add all the time, so no.

Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope),\nbut then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS\ninformation is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS\nmanufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the\nmotherboard.

Sort of.\n\n\tAs long as it wasn't done too terribly often.  Otherwise I think it\nwould get annoying and the user would go looking for other software.\n\n> > > This is silly.

If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be\nreinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is \"this\nsoftware has already been registered to <blank> and it is against the law to\ninstall it on other machines.\"  Or something similar; Access for Windows\ndoes this and it only requires a click on \"OK\" to go away.

However, I am leary of this\nmethod because it a) requires a lot of parts, and, more importantly, b)\ncreates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line. I\nrealize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference,\nbut that would require more parts and boost the price further.\n\tSomeone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 8\nbits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all on-chip.\nUnfortunately, he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer;\nif anyone else has heard of this chip, please e-mail me.\n\tI am building this project as a \"dimmer box\" for a light\ncontroller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains\nvery low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user\nwishes to control (well, each channel, at least).

        "content": "There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers\navailable from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and\npossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with\nrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right\nside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a\ngray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow\nyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information\npackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a\ncoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new\ncapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find\nthat the cartidges now last longer.\n\nI don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your\nnearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.\n\nHP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical\ncomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer and\nthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original\ndesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are\nlikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new\ndeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an\noriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no\nsoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping\nthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP\nservice center for further information.\n\nThe PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from\nthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser\nprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a\nraster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material\ndifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the\naccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously\nslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are\nstill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect\nworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\n\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\n\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\n\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\nproblem.\n\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\nlaserjet IV.\n\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\n\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\n\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.\n\n\n-- \nBill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department\nRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511\nwtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED",

I've seen red mask,\nbut most that I've seen are green.\n\nA bakelite board will look brown in colour, and, if the solder mask\nis put on, looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side\n(or just one side) of the board.\nA fibreglass board will look green from the side, because the green\nsolder-mask makes the board appear that colour. If you got a fibreglass\nboard with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour.\nTeflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.\n\nI'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green, so they're\nnot about to change.

Just\na brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool.

Thanx in advanced.\n\n---------->\nThe whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency.\n\nClass D amps *are* PWM (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much like\nswitching power supplies. I think I've seen these things called \"class S\"\nbefore as well. They're capable of very high efficiencies, and would be suitable\nfor very high power. I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile\namp, though.  I've been trying to design a three-kilowatter for the last year\n(to be used as an inverter for an UPS), but have been having serious problems\nwith layout parasitics (10 IRF 450's in parallel... any help  with a  do-able\nisolated drive ckt would be appreciated :) ) \n\nI'm not absolutely positive about this, but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one that\noperates off a variable- or switched power supply rail voltage. The Carver\namps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit \n(I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, and\nI beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found that\nit had three rail voltages that it switched between. I ran a simulation on\nPSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat)\nunder large-signal conditions, or when driving reactive loads (which draw high\ncurrent at the zero-voltage crossings). \n\nThink SPEAKER.......             /|              Dr. Diode\n                              ||/ |           ------|>|------\n \"Great sound  starts with    ||  |           warren@eggo.csee.usf.edu\n      The Source\"             ||\\ |           warren@renoir.cftnet.com\n                                 \\|",

That fixed it.\n\nSecond:  Flyback...for the life of me, I can't isolate this one.  If I\nleave the cover off, the TV will be quiet.  If I put the cover back on,\nand let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the\ncover on!! :-(\n\nA friend of mine who used to fix TV's says there might be a pin-hole\nleak somewhere on the flyback.

(I am almost\n>sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be\n>wrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel\n>like thinking through it right now.)\n\nThe major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution.\nPbSO4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  Also, H2SO4\nis in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of\nPbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.\n\n>What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,\n>is exothermic, or energy discharging.\n\nAs it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).\n(More about this later.)\n\nWhat actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:\n(we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)\nThe battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things\nhappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead\n           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).\n        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution\n           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).\nNow, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate\nin a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)\nwe end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4\nforms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this\nhappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).\n\nThe precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If\nthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate\n(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.\n\nI have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they\nare for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore\nthe lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with\nthese products for a newer battery.\n\n[stuff deleted]\n>To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on\n>concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's\n>Principle, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will\n>act to move to a more comfortable position.

A logical consequence of the above argument is this:\n\"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to\n -50 to 'pull' the reaction along.\"  We all know from experience (at\n least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is\nnot true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm\nthe battery.\n\n(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge\n to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any\n such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This\n is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool\n during storage.)\n\nJust keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged!",

I figured on\nsubstituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the\nantenna coil, etc., myself.\n\nThe only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning\ncapacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which\nused to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  Well these things seem to\nbe all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  Trimmer\ncapacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this\napplication.\n\nSo, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the \n0--360 pF range?\n\nManythanks.\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreg Neill,               | ounce (ouns), n. - The standard unit of\nHNSX Supercomputers   Inc.|   prevention, equal to one pound of cure.\ngneill@cid.aes.doe.ca     |",

I'm making a 7 stepper controller board, \nwith 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.\n   One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is \nbi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  Look for a chip \nnumbered 74LS245.  If you don't have this, then it's probably a 74LS244, \nwhich will do you NO good for reading in.\n  \n          Now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:\n  First, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.\n  In pascal, you would \"Write(Port[xxx]);\" where xxx is the address in \neither hex or decimal.  The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the \nstrobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, \nso for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  You can also output \nto these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  In pascal, \ndo \"Port[xxx]:=value\n\".\n \n                Hope this helps.\n        Let me know if you need more help.\n \n \n  _________________________________________________\n  Inspiration  |   ___                             |\n  comes to     |  \\   o  baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca |\n  those who    | (  ^  ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca |\n  seek the     |   /-\\      =] Baden de Bari [=    |\n  unknown.     |                                   |\n  -------------------------------------------------",

One application is soldering\nto the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These\nwere notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.\nIf you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver\noff of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated\nsolution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be\ndisolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts\nare quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.\n--\n-->>>>>>>>>> Peter Reilley ..... pvr@wiis.wang.com .....

Quite a few tape recorders are\nbeing brought into Canada from Red China.  In China there is no warranty for\nthe equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it's yours.  One of my\nco-workers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was\nalmost 50%.\n\nAlso, the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular\nprinting press.  An old lithographer friend had a press for this.  After the\netching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on doors.\n> \n-- \n73, Tom\n================================================================================\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the\nlong cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  I\nwould suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short\npeaks.\n\nYou can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or try\nstrapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out,\nwhich will minimize the line drop.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\nan \"air core resonant transformer\". The TV flyback version Tesla\ncoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\ndiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\n\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly\nefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\nwhich are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\nreactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\nefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\nresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\nfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\nscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\nfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\nTesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter\nand die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind\nto a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,\ngas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and\ntelegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????\n\nGET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE\nTODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!\n\nIf it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.\n(flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).\n\n----\n ET   \"Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes\".\n----",

I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a\nDRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the\ncontroller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.\n\nThe only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National\nSemiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would\nlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to\nimplement in my circuit.\n\nBTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas\nSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer\nChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM\nmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the\npower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).

For instance, my \n486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do \nAD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.\n\nThe fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may \nhave a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.  \n\n33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.  FYI: the AT bus \noperates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus \ninterface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.\n\n-rdd\n\n---\n . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

        "content": "Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a\ncouple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\noff ;-)\n\nThanks again everyone...\n\n-=-= Wes =-=-",

Your 2F2 cap\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\nThe other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\nthe cold).\n\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\n\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\n\nCaveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\nconditions.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least\nthat's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface\nGuide. It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes\nfor the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking\nthe player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired\ncontroller.\n\n\nJim Keais        jkeais@ucssun1.sdsu.edu",

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\n\nFor power:\n\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\n\nFor amplitude\n\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\n\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\n\nCommon references for audio are:\n\n\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\n\t0 dBV = 1 volt\n\n\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\n\t0 VU = -10dBV\t(consumer gear line level)\n\n\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\nor moment.\n\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)",

A single chip\nmicro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only\ncosts about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed\nthe whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,\nuse the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely\non the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want\nto try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut\nyou a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.\n\nIf you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of \nmaybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET\nto fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than \nyou can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add\na power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count\nscreams up to 9.\n\nPD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This\napplication is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the \nprogrammer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.\n\nJohn\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nNeed Usenet public Access in Atlanta?

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\nthem, So:\n\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\nthe RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more\nstable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...\nas I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new\ncapacitor will 'smooth' this out.\n\nand\n2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to\nbe placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out\nthe 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !\n\n  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH\nof a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my \ndissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not\nplaying with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long\nrun... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)\n\nEmail please....

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\nfall...\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)",

Chiu knows the score and is just being\nsilly. However, \"decibel\" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is\nright on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.\n\nStrictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,\nand a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,\nhence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).\n\nThe bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are\nall named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine\nway to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.\nHertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,\nbut had been left out in having a term or unit named after him\nuntil recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)\nAll the other units were defined many decades earlier.\n\n\n \n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------",

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a\ncurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side\nto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I\nthink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.\n\nAnyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for\npicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a\ncouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an\nefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my\ncar battery in about half an hour).\n\nUnfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic\nspecs as a heat pump.

The only way \nto get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The \n\"gain\" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred \ndirection) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.\n\nBob Sciamanda\nEdinboro Univ of PA",

        "content": "I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by\nbuying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile\nI noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there\nseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,\nI have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some\nrandom 50mV bias.\n\tThe other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output\nwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed\nfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input\nimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have\nmaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have\ninput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of\na pain in  the ass.\n\tIs there any way I could make myself a little box that could\nsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator\ninput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some\nlow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor\nof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd\nlike to have this box not be active.\n\tAny quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I\nhad sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it.

Each distributor represents and sells a variety of\ndifferent non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?\nSuppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good\nbet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.\nThey also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer\nthey represent.\n\nWho knows?

A continuous conductor is a good \nelectrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that need\nshielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic\nfields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,\nlike a Faraday cage.\n\nThe flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances,\nyou could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.\nYou aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be a\nreal problem (one that bit me once).",

Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring\nand tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener\nand LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever\nscheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on \nthe frontend.\n\nAlso remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm\nequivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets\ndropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly\n12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.

This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to\nswitchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,\nas you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.\n\nAnother way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you\nlose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to\nreplace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and\nyou've got to resync the AC in no time flat.\n\nUnfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that\nAC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to\nbe usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.\n\nSimilar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back\nin the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they\ndid back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you\nit'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul\neveryone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.\n\n.",

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV\nIn order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than\nthat.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect\ninside a PC.\n\nBefore you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low\ndistortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.

That's should give you a good indication of the design.\n(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed\n- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)\n\nIf you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at\nthe MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete\nsampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it\nuses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated\nfrom the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design\nguide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db\nmax (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces\n\nA evaluation kit is available.

No current is supposed to flow in it\nunder normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in\nit either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if\nyou're grounded in some other way at the same time.  \n\nThe neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for\nthe hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you\nplug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly \nmeasure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  \n\nThey are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,\nrepeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things\nlike sub-panels.)\n\nWhat you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is \nto use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,\ndepending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.\n\nThere is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and\nnews.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and\nyou should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy\nto you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in\nthe future. \n\n\t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA\nInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055",

If\n\tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't\n\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\n\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\n\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\n\n\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\n\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\n\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\n\twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections\n\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,\n\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\n\n\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\n\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\n\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\n\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\n\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\n\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\n\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\n\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\n\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\n\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\n\trules.\n\n\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\n\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\n\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\n\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\n\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\n\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've\n\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or\n\t``CEC''.\n\n\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\n\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\n\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\n\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\n\tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\n\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\n\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the\n\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged\n\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\n\tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\n\tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the\n\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for\n\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\n\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\n\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\n\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\n\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\n\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\n\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\n\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\n\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\n\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\n\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\n\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\n\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\n\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\n\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\n\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\n\n\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\n\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\n\tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't\n\toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\n\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\n\tequivalent NEC publications.\n\n\tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\n\tthe province.\n\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\n\n\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\n\tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical\n\tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's\n\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\n\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\n\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\n\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\n\twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\n\tfind one willing to supervise.\n\n\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\n\n\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\n\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,\n\tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make\n\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\n\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\n\tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that\n\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,\n\tand will impress the inspector.\n\n\tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to\n\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\n\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.\n\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\n\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\n\n\tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.\n\n\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip\n\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\n\twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it\n\ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of\n\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\n\n\tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C\n\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\n\tbecome very brittle.\n\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\n\n\tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\n\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're \n\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\n\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\n\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\n\n\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\n\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or\n\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\n\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\n\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\n\tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even\n\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\n\n\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\n\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\n\twork well).\n\t\n\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\n\tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\n\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\n\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\n\tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should\n\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\n\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\n\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't\n\tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.\n\n\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\n\tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.\n\n\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\n\n\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\n\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire\n\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\n\taccurate.\n\n\tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\n\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\n\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\n\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\n\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip\n\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to\n\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\n\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\n\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\n\tthat you'll gouge the conductors.\n\n\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well\n\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\n\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\n\tor the insulation.\n\n\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\n\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\n\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\n\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\n\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\n\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\n\n\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\n\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\n\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\n\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known\n\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\n\n\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\n\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\n\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\n\n\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\n\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\n\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \n\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\n\tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\n\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\n\tthat has no cover plate).\n\nSubject: What is UL listing?\n\n\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\n\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\n\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\n\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\n\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\n\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily\n\tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just\n\tthat it probably won't kill you.\n\n\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\n\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\n\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\n\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\n\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\n\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\n\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\n\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\n\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\n\toccupancy permits issued.\n\t\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\n\n\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\n\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\n\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\n\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\n\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\n\trequired by law.\n\n\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\n\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\n\tclaim.\n\n\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\n\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\n\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\n\tcompanies.\n\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\n\n\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\n\n\t    Residential Wiring\n\t    by Jeff Markell,\n\t    Craftsman Books,\n\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\n\n\t    Practical Electrical Wiring\n\t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\n\t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\n\t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan\n\t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.\n\n\t    Wiring Simplified\n\t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan\n\t    Park Publishing Co.\n\t\n\tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC\n\trevision.  Which is currently 1990.\n\n\tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\n\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\n\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\n\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\n\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get\n\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\n\tquestions on the net ;-).\n\n\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\n\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\n\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\n\n\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\n\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\n\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\n\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\n\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\n\tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose\n\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\n\n\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\n\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\n\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\n\tthis.\n\n\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\n\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\n\tclaims.\n\n\tIn general, the process goes like this:\n\t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\n\t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\n\t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\n\t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not\n\t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose\n\t\t  special conditions on you, require loading\n\t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\n\t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\n\t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to\n\t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\n\t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\n\t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\n\t\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\n\t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\n\t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\n\t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\n\t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\n\t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".\n\nSubject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.\n\tDo I have to upgrade?\n\n\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\n\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\n\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\n\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you\n\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\n\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\n\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\n\n\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\n\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\n\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\n\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\n\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\n\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\n\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\n\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not\n\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\n\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\n\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\n\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\n\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\n\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\n\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\n\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\n\n\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\n\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\n\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\n\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\n\tlow.\n\n\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\n\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\n\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\n\tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.\n\n\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\n\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\n\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\n\n\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\n\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\n\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\n\n \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\n \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\n \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\n\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\n\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\n\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\n\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\n\tnormally carries no current.\n\n\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\n\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\n\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\n\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\n\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\n\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\n\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\n\n\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\n\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\n\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\n\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\n\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\n\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\n\n\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\n\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\n\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\n\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \n\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\n\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\n\tinspector.\n\n\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\n\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\n\twell.\n\n\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\n\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\n\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\n\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\n\n\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\n\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\n\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\n\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\n\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\n\tservice).\n\nSubject: What is a circuit?\n\n\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\n\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\n\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\n\t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\n\t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\n\t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\n\t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\n\n\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\n\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\n\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\n\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\n\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\n\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\n\tair conditioners.\n\n\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\n\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\n\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\n\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\n\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\n\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\n\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\n\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\n\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\n\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\n\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\n\tpermissible.]\n\n\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\n\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\n\n\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\n\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\n\n\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\n\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\n\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\n\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\n\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\n\n\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\n\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\n\n\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\n\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\n\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\n\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\n\talternative to GFCI protection.\n\nSubject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\n\n\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\n\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\n\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\n\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\n\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\n\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\n\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\n\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\n\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\n\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\n\ttogether in the panel.\n\n\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\n\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\n\n\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\n\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\n\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\n\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\n\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\n\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\n\n\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\n\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\n\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\n\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\n\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\n\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\n\tequipment itself won't cause a fire.\n\n\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\n\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\n\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\n\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\n\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\n\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\n\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\n\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\n\treplaced.\n\n\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\n\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\n\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\n\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\n\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\n\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\n\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\n\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\n\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\n\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\n\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\n\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\n\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\n\tpurpose.\n\n\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\n\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\n\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\n\tcan often cause severe damage.\n\nSubject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?\n\n\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\n\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\n\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\n\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\n\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\n\tpenny\" trick.\n\n\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\n\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\n\n\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\n\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\n\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\n\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\n\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\n\tBreakers don't do this.\n\n\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\n\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\n\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\n\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\n\n\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\n\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\n\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\n\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\n\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\n\tif you need one.\n\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\n\n\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\n\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\n\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\n\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\n\t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.\n\n\tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\n\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\n\tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate\n\theat easily:\n\n\t\tGauge\t\tAmps\n\t\t14\t\t15\n\t\t12\t\t20\n\t\t10\t\t30\n\t\t8\t\t40\n\t\t6\t\t65\n\t\n\tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\n\ton the application and precise wire type.\n\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\n\n\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\n\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\n\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\n\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\n\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\n\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\n\truns.\n\n\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\n\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\n\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\n\tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits\n\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\n\twire.\n\nSubject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\n\n\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\n\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\n\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\n\tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\n\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\n\n\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\n\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\n\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\n\n\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\n\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\n\nSubject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\n\tused?\n\n\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used\n\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\n\tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\n\n\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\n\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\n\n\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the\n\twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically\n\tsecure.\n\n\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\n\tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the\n\tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.\n\n\tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\n\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\n\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\n\tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\n\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\n\n\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\n\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\n\ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because\n\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\n\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\n\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\n\n\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures\n\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\n\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\n\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\n\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\n\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\n\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\n\tthe circuit.\n\n\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\n\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\n\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\n\twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\n\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\n\tGFCI happy.\n\n\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\n\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\n\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\n\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\n\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\n\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\n\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\n\n\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\n\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,\n\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\n\tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water\n\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\n\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',\n\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\n\tlaundry appliances.\n\n\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\n\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\n\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\n\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to\n\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\n\n\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\n\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\n\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\n\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\n\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\n\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\n\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\n\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\n\nSubject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?\n\n\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a\n\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\n\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\n\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\n\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\n\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\n\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\n\tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no\n\tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring\n\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\n\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\n\n\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\n\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\n\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\n\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\n\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\n\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\n\tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\n\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a\n\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\n\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\n\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\n\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\n\n\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\n\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\n\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.\n\n\tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one\n\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't\n\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\n\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\n\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\n\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\n\n\tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little\n\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\n\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\n\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\n\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\n\nSubject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\n\n\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,\n\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without\n\ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against\n\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\n\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an\n\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\n\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\n\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\n\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\n\tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of\n\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\n\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\n\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\n\n\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\n\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\n\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\n\telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will\n\thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;\n\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\n\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to\n\tground...\n\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\n\n\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\n\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\n\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\n\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\n\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\n\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\n\n\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\n\n\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\n\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\n\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\n\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\n\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\n\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\n\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\n\n\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\n\tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\n\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\n\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\n\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\n\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\n\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\n\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\n\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be\n\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\n\n\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\n\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\n\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\n\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\n\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\n\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\n\tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect\n\tfrom downstream outlets.\n\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\n\n\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\n\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\n\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\n\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\n\n\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\n\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\n\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\n\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\n\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\n\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\n\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\n\n\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\n\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\n\tfairly resistant to damage.\n\n\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\n\tsheath.\n\t\n\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\n\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\n\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\n\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\n\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\n\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\n\n\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\n\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\n\tbut this is technically illegal.]\n\n\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\n\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\n\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\n\tand CEC):\n\n\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\n\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\n\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\n\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\n\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\n\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\n\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\n\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\n\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\n\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\n\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\n\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\n\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\n\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\n\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box\n\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.\n\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\n\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\n\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\n\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\n\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\n\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\n\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\n\t      in the breach...]\n\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\n\t      similar finish.\n\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\n\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\n\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\n\t      than 1m (39\").\n\n\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\n\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\n\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\n\tthe insulation.\n\n\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\n\tsolid wall coverings.\n\n\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\n\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\n\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\n\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\n\twire.\n\n\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\n\n\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\n\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\n\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\n\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\n\twiring section.]\n\n \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\n \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\n \tpurpose.\n\n\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\n\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\n\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\n\tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\n\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\n\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\n\t\n \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\n \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\n \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\".\n\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\n\n\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\n\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\n\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\n\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything\n\tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.\n\n\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\n\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\n\n\tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC\n\n\tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\n\tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc.\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90\n\t\n\tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF\n\tService entrance\t\t\tRWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTWU\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90\n\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]\n\nSubject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\n\n\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\n\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\n\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\n\tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.\n\n\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\n\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\n\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\n\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\n\n\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\n\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\n\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\n\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\n\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\n\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\n\n\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\n\n\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible\n\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\n\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\n\tget nasty.\n\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\n\n\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\n\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\n\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\n\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\n\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\n\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\n\twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\n\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\n\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\n\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\n\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\n\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\n\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\n\n\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\n\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\n\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\n\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\n\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\n\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\n\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\n\tmounted between the joists.\n\n\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\n\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\n\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\n\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\n\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\n\t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\n\twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*\n\tlong)\n\n\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\n\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\n\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\n\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.\n\tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't\n\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\n\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get\n\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\n\tin later.]\n\n\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\n\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\n\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\n\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\n\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\n\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\n\tfor the sensor can vary.\n\n\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\n\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.\n\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\n\n\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\n\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\n\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\n\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\n\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\n\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\n\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\n\n\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\n\tand have them come and check out the problem.\n\n\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\n\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\n\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\n\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\n\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\n\n\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\n\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\n\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\n\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\n\n\tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\n\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\n\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\n\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\n\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\n\n\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\n\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\n\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\n\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\n\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\n\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\n\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\n\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\n\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an\n\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\n\n\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\n\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\n\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\n\n\tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there\n\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\n\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\n\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\n\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\n\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\n\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\n\n\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\n\tthan 50 feet long.\n\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\n\n\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\n\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\n\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\n\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\n\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\n\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\n\n\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\n\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\n\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\n\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\n\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\n\tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that\n\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\n\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far\n\tmore current than it can continuously.\n\n\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\n\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,\n\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\n\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\n\n\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\n\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\n\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\n\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\n\n\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\n\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\n\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\n\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\n\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\n\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\n\t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can\n\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\n\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\n\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\n\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\n\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\n\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\n\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\n\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\n\t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\n\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\n\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't\n\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\n\t       on BX cable.\n\n\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\n\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\n\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\n\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\n\tShould the test button work?\n\n\tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\n\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's\n\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\n\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\n\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\n\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require\n\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\n\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\n\tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially\n\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\n\n\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\n\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\n\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\n\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\n\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\n\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\n\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\n\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\n\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\n\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\n\tit, and promised to investigate.)\n\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\n\n\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\n\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\n\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\n\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\n\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\n\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\n\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\n\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\n\twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\n\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\n\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\n\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\n\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\n\tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\n\n\tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the\n\tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.\n\tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\n\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\n\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\n\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\n\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\n\twrong.\n\n\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\n\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\n\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\n\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\n\n\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\n\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\n\tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you\n\tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled\n\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\n\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much\n\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\n\n\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\n\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\n\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\n\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\n\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe''\n\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\n\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\n\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\n\t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.\n\n\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\n\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\n\teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop\n\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\n\thave a different idea.\n\n\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\n\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\n\nSubject: Underground Wiring\n\n\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\n\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\n\ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots\n\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\n\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\n\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\n\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\n\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\n\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\n\tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.\n\n\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\n\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\n\tyour specific situation.\n\n\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\n\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\n\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\n\n\tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\n\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\n\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\n\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\n\tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new\n\twiring.\n\n\tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\n\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\n\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\n\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\n\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\n\n\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\n\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\n\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\n\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\n\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\n\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\n\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\n\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\n\tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even\n\tcause a fire.\n\n\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\n\tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of\n\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing\n\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\n\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\n\tfor the following things:\n\n\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\n\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\n\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\n\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\n\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\n\n\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\n\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\n\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\n\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\n\t       up each connection.\n\n\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\n\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\n\n\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\n\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\n\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\n\n\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\n\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\n\t       be repaired.\n\t    \n\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\n\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\n\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\n\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\n\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\n\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\n\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\n\t       you can rent the tool.\n\n\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\n\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\n\t    \n\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\n\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\n    \n\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\n\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\n\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\n\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\n\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\n\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\n\tYou can do this yourself too.\n\nSubject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?\n\n\tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire\n\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\n\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\n\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\n\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\n\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\n\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\n\n\tHere's some hints on what to look for:\n\n\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\n\n\t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\n\t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\n\t\t  proper marking.\n\t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\n\t\t  a GFCI)\n\t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\n\t\t- Switched neutrals\n\t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\n\n\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\n\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\n\n\t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\n\t\t   not properly terminated wiring)\n\t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\n\t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\n\t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-)\n\t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\n\t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\n\t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\n\t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\n\t\t  ceiling\n\t\t- Backwrapped grounding wires\n\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\n\t\n\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\n\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\n\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \n\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\n\n\tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called\n\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\n\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\n\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\n\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\n\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\n\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\n\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\n\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\n\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\n\tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\n\tcolour as the hot wires.\n\n\tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.\n\n\tComments on K&T:\n\n\t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\n\t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\n\t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\n\t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in\n\t\t  quite good condition.\n\t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\n\t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\n\t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\n\t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\n\t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between\n\t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\n\t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\n\t\t  any circuit.\n\t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\n\t\t  that contain K&T.\n\t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\n\t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\n\t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\n\t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\n\t\n\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't\n\tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should\n\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\n\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly\n\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\n\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\n\t\n\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\n\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\n\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\n\tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.\n\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\n\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole\n\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\n\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\n\n\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\n\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\n\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\n\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\n\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\n\ttubing.\n\n\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\n\tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\n\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard\n\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\n\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\n\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.\n\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\n\n\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\n\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\n\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\n\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\n\tknow what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable\n\tsales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.\n-- \nChris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541\nPsroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca\nFerret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca",

Is this true?\n\nI own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no\n  amp which can touch it at the price range.\nThe build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other \n  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid\n  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.\nIf you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components \n  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect\n  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each\n  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\n\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\n  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components\n  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the\n  amplifiers sound so brilliant.\nI cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with\n  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly\n  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.\n\nMy last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like\n  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded\n  like new.\n\nIf you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will\n  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.\n\nJust my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.\n\n--\n***********************************************************************\n**    Alan Webber                                                    **\n**                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                                                                   **\n** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **\n** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **\n** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **\n** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    **\n***********************************************************************",

There is a boom that comes from\nthe side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned\nin front of the user's eye.\n\nThe Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA\ncompatible.

I found it easiest to use if I\nlooked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking\nif I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.\nThe unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found\nannoying.

Consider this:\n\n------10K--------+---------? ohm ----\n                 |\nGen            50 ohm            D.U.T.\n(loaded)         |\n-----------------+-------------------\n\nThink about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy\nto which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can\nvirtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the\nmillivolt test generator you want.\n\nGood luck,\n\n\n-- \nBill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department\nRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511\nwtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED",

Because You never get all thermic energy out of  \nthe powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  \nof the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  \noil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  \nthe turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  \nsteam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  \nsomething else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  \ntype of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  \nunobjectionable).

There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\n\n  While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on\nreceive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I\ndidn't bother with it.\n\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data\nstream is another matter entirely.\n\n  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\n\"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow\ndue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO\nalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.

The antenna is horizontally\npolarized.\n\n  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly\napproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and\nyou might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can't\narrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think\nyou'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by\nmultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.\nFor more details, see the 10th CNC.

Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the\ninput of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both\nchips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  \n\nIf you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an\noutboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good\nenough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and\nbalance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of\nthe volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably \nbefore the other controls).  \n\nIf the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should\nprobably forget the whole thing. \n\n\t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA\nInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055",

To assist cooling\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\nhot pipes.

At\nnuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas\nfossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot\nwater.

        "subject": "Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring",
        "content": "There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\n\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\nconductor.  \n\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \n\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \n\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \n\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\npresent a shock hazard.  \n\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\n\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \n\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\n\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \n(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not\nit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\n\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\n\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\nit's primarily for lightning protection.\n\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\naluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \n\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\ngreenfield.\n\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\n\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\nGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be\nrenumbered though.) \n\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \n\nJohn\n-- \n*******************************************************************************\nJohn H.

(There's a gripe in the industry\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\nas cold as possible.

Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \npollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \n\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\nthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \ncooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Nagle",

It's not fully\nup to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different\nmanufacturer's synonyms):\n\n------\nIn practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view\nof the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my\nviews on things like availability and backward compatibility):\n\n74\tThe original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively\n\tobsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball\n\tfunctions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.\n\n74H\tModification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher\n\tpower consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74L\tModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.\n\tVery obsolete; use CMOS.\n\n74S\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\n\tpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74LS\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\n\tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\n\tdevices.\n\n74F\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\n\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\n\n74AS\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\n\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\n\n74ALS\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\n\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\n\n74C\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\n\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\n\tCMOS 74 families.\n\n4000\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\n\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\n\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\n\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\n\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\n\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\n\tclear choice when speed is not important.\n\n74HC\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\n\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\n\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\n\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\n\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\n\tconsumption at faster speeds.\n\n74HCT\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\n\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\n\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\n\n10K\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\n\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\n\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\n\tthe rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\n\tcan be expensive.\n\n100K\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\n\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\n\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\n\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\ninteresting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\n-- \nAll work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry",

It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,\nusually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically\ntakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed \nto cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?",

(Poor you!)\n\nThe Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you \nsouldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of \ncopying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to \nthe protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the \nprotection.\n\nOne thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape \nfor viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an \nextra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR \nfirst, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I \ndon't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want \nto make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.\n\nvictor@inqmind.bison.mb.ca\nThe Inquiring Mind BBS, Winnipeg, Manitoba  204 488-1607",

OK ?\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\n         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry \n         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-\n         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find\n         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \n         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"\n         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\n         energy that carnot will give them.\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\n         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\n         \n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with\n         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\n         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \n\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have\n         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and\n         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.\n         \n\nOnly my 0.02$ !\n\nChristian Reisel \n\nstudent of electronic sciences\n\n-- \nChristian Reisel, Goldammerweg 2, W-6601 Buebingen, Germany\nVoice        +49 6805 22179 Fax & Email  +49 6805 22179\n\nPGP PubKey:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nbegin 777 pcr.pub\nMF5L`P`\"S*Q%296ES96PL($-H<FES=&EA;OX!P7R5'F0QY1Q_.=+SY(;DZ0L:6\nMMO(]]0`=K?/VH[U-\"6MX]7G\\-MF]/;&`H5KL/%,M\\$:89^5FI6;W:$T$;9M!Q\n$+04`$0`=@\n``\nend",

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\nadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\").  \n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\n\n>       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual \n>boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\n>rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \n>pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \n\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\nnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \n\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\ncosts.  \n\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\ncondenser area.\n\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\n\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\npressure.\n\n>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

        "content": ">I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option\n>known as \"differential ready\".  Apparently land-based\n>beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS \n>receiver (with differential option installed).\n\n>How does this system work?  What frequency is used for\n>the land-based beacons?\n\n>Thanks in advance,\n\n>Charlie Thompson\n>.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\nunit.\n\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\nwhich has stations all across the US.\n\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn P.

In our case, other\nmonitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be\nspecific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this\nproblem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc\nseveral 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the\njuice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side\nof wall maybe?\nWe started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input\nlines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference\neffect on the computer monitor next to it. \nNow on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very\ncommon, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type\nO'scopes).\nI talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount\naround deflection coil of interfering monitor. \nBE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH\nVOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T\nBLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO\nMOUNT CAN.\nNow, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also\ngood at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on\nmonitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other\nsources.\n\nJeff Babb\nbabb@sciences.sdsu.edu   babb@ucssun1.sdsu.edu\nProgrammer, SDSU - LARC",

If you have an idea about its voltage and current \nratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with \nanything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating \nof approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely \"ON\" \nat +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or \nless voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is \nused as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to \nexperiment with various gain-altering techniques.\n\nBill Willis     willisw@coe-nw.clemson.edu\n(803) 656-5550",

I have noticed that the waveform \nsynthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large\ncommon mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another\ntransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred \ntimes.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to\nmake my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with \nline frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).\n\nHow can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an\nHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to \n'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the \ninput since it will read accurately down to DC.\n\nAlso, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, \nhow important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected \nto the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused \nby different cable capacitances)?

It is very unlikely, however,\nthat a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\nfor cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\nradio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \naway.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\nIf you experience the problem frequently, it may be \ncaused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\nnearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \ntransmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\netc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\ncorrect in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\nIf you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\nchokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\nbeing picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\nbe installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\nGood instructions are included with the chokes.\nIf that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\nneighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\nor car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\na radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\n-- \n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nRandall Rhea                                        Informix Software, Inc. \nProject Manager, MIS Sales/Marketing Systems    uunet!pyramid!infmx!randall",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd\nlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to\nuse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation\nconsoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.\n\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\n\nI've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\ncuetape!)\n\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\nof some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured\nout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMark Fontana\n\n-- \n \"Of all the arts, the cinema is  |  Mark A.

It is very unlikely, however,\n   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\n\nNot possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for\njust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\ndown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\n\n   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \ncause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \n\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\nToo bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers\nto take any precautions.\n\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\nthan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\nCB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nDouglas S.

Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the\nspectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).\n\npossibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people\nwith false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up\nmost of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other things\nto `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably not\nwork as well, if it worked at all.

Stronger sources are\ngoing to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as\nfluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV\nsources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.

Strictly,\na 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change\nstate, according to the inputs.\n\nA demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which\nof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are\nthree inputs required.\n\nA decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable\ninput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all\noutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output\nwill be low).\n\nAn eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to\nselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\n\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\nfour enable lines.\n\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\nfour final stage decoders.\n\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

If you want correct RMS for (most)\nany waveform, you need a \"True-RMS\" DVM/DMM which literally does the\nRoot-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.\n\n: \n:    Related question (less important to me):\n:    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with \n: analog ones? \n\nThe last significant advantage of analog (IMO) ** was ** being able to\n\"see\" the signal if it was changing over time (e.g.  checking\nelectrolytic capacitors).\n\nAnymore, most DMM have bargraphs, etc. that duplicate this.\n\n: \n:    Thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at\n: avm1993@zeus.tamu.edu or open a discussion here.

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically\nmodified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600\nmight have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight\nof the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.\n\nAdditionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for\ntheir games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I\nwould hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking\nwith the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the\n2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).\nAlso I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into\na RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to\nbackup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could\nbe bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them\ninto a special RAM cartidge, and play them.\n\nAnyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got\ntwo 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa\ncartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and\nhandling. Don't play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo\n(interested in that too?).\n\nHope that helps your question... I might grab some 6502's out too,\nsince they must be fun to play with (as microcontrollers).\n-shishin \"squish\" yamada\nsquish@endor.harvard.edu",

Recall also that laser printers\noffer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1\nppm for an ink jet printer.\n\nSomething else to think about is the cost of consumables over the\nlife of the printer.

When I asked, people said that the\ninterpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more\ncomplicated.\n\nAnyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\"\nsampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\nantialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling\nlets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher\noversamplings lets you build better filters.

It gives the nicest outputs, with only\na minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters,\nresumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to\nlook a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).

Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together\n>for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?\n\nYou can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, \"The\nHungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food,\" by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\nspaced every 6\" starting about 10\" above the bulb.\n\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\nfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it\noften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are\nusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway\nthrough.\n\nIf you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub\nfor this stuff.\n\ngerald.belton@ozonehole.com\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.\n                       \n----\nThe Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-3142\n3 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 Files\nSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet Newsgroups\nPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com",

Since we apparently\ndon't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing\ncameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests\nare going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the\nvideo being piped into a command center they're building\nsomewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or\ncheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large\nmulti-colored status displays will show the various routes\nusing different colors to represent the various average speeds\nfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front\nof the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic\nstatus to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also\nlooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to\nproviding continuous audio from this system.\n\nIn the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display\nboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data\non traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the\nsystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it\nwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is\nsimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read\n\"cheap\").\n\nWe also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP\naudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal\nreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle\nreceivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is\napplicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some\nother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\ndon't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You\nmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing\nmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)\n\nI think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more\ninfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.\n\nCheers,\nAlan\n<acooney@netcom.com>",

When I asked, people said that the\n>interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more\n>complicated.\n\nYou are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not\ninterpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal\nyou are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an\nall-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's\nheart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks\nthat weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the\nproperly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at\nthat point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not\nunreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things\nin realtime if you write efficient code.\n\nIn case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)\nfilter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out\nthere know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with\nresistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as\nthe most cost effective method for volume production runs.\n\n\n>Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\"\n>sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\n>antialiasing filters.

I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to\nfilter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and\ngive the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they\ncharge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.\n\nI seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.

GANDLER) writes:\n>\n>\tHow does the radio Electronics free information cards work.\n>Do they just send you some general information about the companies that\n>advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a\n>catalog. \n\nThat depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\ndata on computer disk.\n\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\n\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.\n\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\nthe serious potential customers.\n\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\n\nWhat's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\n\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\n  weeks later.\n\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\n  on a computer printout.\n\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\n\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.\n  Advertisers almost never call. \n\nJohn Schuch\n  publisher of: The Arizona High-Tech Times\n                The Arizona Electrical Journal\n                The Arizona HVAC News\n  (all of which have bingo cards)",

If you want to protect you soft, supply a\n>good documentation and support. This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively \n>protecting software.\n\nThere are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the\nuser is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is\nfor the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on\n(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different\nmachine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  \n\nThe program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends\non the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user \ndid an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.\nNo document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!\n\nI did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's \nconscience should do that.\n\nI know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of \"casual\"\nusers who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights\n(It's the truth.  I have \"friends\" who ask me for copies of my latest games\nall the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casual\npirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection will\ndiscourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my \"friends\" dug up\nsomewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actual\nrelease!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable\nthe quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determined\npirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread \nthat far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once\nfound by authorities.  It is the \"casual\" pirates that the copy protection is\ndetermined to discourage.\n\nWhat I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus\na special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup\n\"REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip\" and disables the above.\nTwo benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and\nmakes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is\nencrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a\nstable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus\nviolated their license agreement.\n\nThis way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal \ndiscomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only\nproblem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.\n\nThe registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore\ngains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,\nthe software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is \nsupposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not \nsupposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,\na hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?\n\n--Kasey Chang",

Also, make sure that your\nprogram can not be run out a debugger.\n\nAnother method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk,\njust write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here,\nyou also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.\nMake sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with\ngarbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in\nsome random sector.\n\nLike you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they\nare both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the\nopposite of what you want.\n\nAnother configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the\nmachine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can\nthink of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, it\nrequests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk should\nbe encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything\nelse you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Once\nagain, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC\nchecks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among other\nthings, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects a\nchange in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the\nprogram.

Carpenter) writes:\n>\n>> I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the\n>> distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?\n>\n>Yes. It's called RADAR.\nWell, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances\nby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its\nreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters\nuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of\nthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,\nthe original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500\nfeet altitude.\n\nNote, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster\noriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between\na transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate\ntime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter\ntriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually\ntravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference\nis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a\ncommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something\nlike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both\nthe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,\nbut plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.\n\nWhy not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again\nthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.\nshould know about anyway ;-).\n\n>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength\n>> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),\n>> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.\n\nThis is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter\nvaries from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission\nline, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit\nover time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With\nthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at\none place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for\nthe R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...\n\n>Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in\n>a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this\n>concept.\n\nNope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless\nthe two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.\nThis is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.\nSignals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...\n\n>> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?\n\nAs high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance\nattenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies\naround 4 GHz.\n\nHope this helps...\n\n-- \n==========================================================\nJack Brindle\nham radio: wa4fib\ninternet: jackb@mdd.comm.mot.com",

I personally am concerned only with a small lab  \nwith ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with  \nadmin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  \nthan a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of  \nyour program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.   \n\"Pirate board\" or no pirate board.  I too have \"friends\" who blatantly and  \nquite successfuly \"hack\" copy protection schemes practically in their  \nsleep.\n\nLet's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one  \nmachine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some  \nsetting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,  \nmostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network  \nadministrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  \n(partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and \"acting\" similar to  \nthe average user, and maintaining \"behind-the-scenes\" consistency is a  \nreal headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  \ndifferent folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  \ndisk.\n\nOften we have hardware problems at peak \"business\" times and have to do  \nsome parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .\n\nWell, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..\n\nThe point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration  \nfiles etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found  \nto do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  \nCOPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  \nmachine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  \nten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  \nthis considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  \nall network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.\n\nOften, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  \nto one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  \nusually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  \nthe original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with \"copy  \nprotection\" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  \n . .\n\nIn short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort  \nof like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and  \nyou will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's  \nguide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this  \nREGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute  \nthe manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but  \nplease take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the  \ncosts of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the  \nlegitimate user with a \"copy protection\" scheme!\n\n\nSorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . .. :-)\n\n\nMark S.

In storage,\neither the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chance\nI'd ever do that at home), or the battery should be stored on a trickle\ncharge.  I have also (I think) read that the condition may be reversable\nif hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time.\nThe refernce I remember is to use C/50 (where C is the amp hours) as the\ncharging circuit, and leave it hooked up for weeks.  Some of this may\nonly apply to Gel type cells, but I suspect the same applies to the liquid\ntype.\n\nRichard Dell",

To get an image on the screen, you had to wait\nuntil the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line\ninto the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many\nduplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. This\ntook all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the\ndisplay.\n\n>There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage\n>regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.\n\nThe RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page\n1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is\nboth shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a\nmachine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it\nalso wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the\nhigh byte of the address is hardwired to 1).\n\nThe IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers\n(can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the\n6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I\nthink this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so\nmany games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do\nsomething else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.\n\nThere was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at\nleast 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I\nimagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly\nto chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so\nthe 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly\nnormal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more\nusual active low chip select.\n\nJohn West",

I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators\n\tand learn the \"black magic\" art of switching power supplies...\n\t(before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-)\n\n\tAnyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with pretty\n\tgood results (>80% efficiency) but I'm running into problems\n\twhen I try to design & build anything that puts out serious\n\tamps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on my\n\tbench) but something puzzles me: I'm using a simple choke as \n\tthe storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)\n\tbut ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings.\n\tI traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for\n\tthe usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose\n\tme...

Also, exact part\n|> numbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!\n\nThe first step is to make sure that there is no DC component, intentional\nor not, on the audio lines to be switched. If neither the output or\ninput presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively\ncoupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and\nfrom the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any\ncoupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.\n\nIf the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than\njust coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before\nswitching with coupling capacitors of your own.\n\nIf you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input\nthrough to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching\nwhere for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch\nchange. This may mask the switch click.\n\nAn audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and\nmaking your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)\nsealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles\nuse this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes\na complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.\nRadio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.\n\nFor a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try \nlooking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its\nolder predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed\nprior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete\nand IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).\nAll the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily\nmake a subject for a multi-page article.\n\nSolid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on\ndue to charge being injected into the audio line through device\ncapacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to\nminimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through\nthe switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the\ncontrol pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as\nputting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.\n\nHope this helps at least get you started.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)",

In order to get the brick -wall, you need enough voltage gain on \nthe current sensor.  Normally a darlington on the current sensing \nresistor will be adequate, but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense \nthe current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to \nturn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor.  Phase compensation \nmay be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more \nthan 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain OK??\n\ndino@inqmind.bison.mb.ca\nThe Inquiring Mind BBS, Winnipeg, Manitoba  204 488-1607",

You see, dirt has good karma,\nsince it's all organic and full of living things, but cement is all squared\noff and artificial looking, and has lost its karma in the process.  Being\na karma sink, it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no\nlonger able to keep a charge.  Because wood is also good and organic, putting\na board between the battery and the cement will fix the problems.\n\nThe Buddha-nature is in the acid, but it is also in the lead plate.  The\nnovice asked the master whether the spongy lead had more of the karma or\nwhether the solid lead had it.  The master handed the novice a 250V B battery,\nterminals downward, and thus the novice was enlightened.\n--scott",

The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer\nin one of eight zones across the stage.

The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional \nto the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body.\nThis could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.\n\nDancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their \nbodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.\n\nThe current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the\nAmiga, used with a LIVE! video digitizer.  This works with a video camera \ntrained on the stage.  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of\nview, and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. Events\ncan be MIDI objects or sequences, Amiga sounds or graphic objects.  It's been\nfun to play with, but the documentaion is arcane, and the digitizer is noisy.\nStill, it's very appealing, the dancers don't have to wear any appliances,\nyou can have ots of zone,s, it speaks MIDI, which can be used to control lights,\nand I don't have to build any electronics.

The transformer is just that - a \ntransformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although\nthe inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT\nnegligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to\nget one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a\n\"snubber\" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended\nfor switcher use today have the diode built in.)\n\nThe basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in\na somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a\nhigh voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or\n\"filter\") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.\nThe transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,\nresulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which \nare then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs\nis sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,\nwhich acts in a \"pulse-width modulation\" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying\nthe pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and\ntherefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs\nmay be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less\ntracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear\nregulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the \nregulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)\nis not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various\nsafety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be\nelectrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator\nto meet this requirement.\n\nWhile the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these\ndesigns, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can\nbe ignored; besides the inductive \"kick\" giving the switch transistor a\nbad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the\nenergy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.\nIn some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,\nyou need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't\nsaturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the \nimagination! :-)).\n\nI'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; \nhopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors\nin the above.\n\n\nBob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not\n                   Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any other\nmyers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.",

The problem is that lead-acid\ncells self discharge over time. Even high quality cells (Gates for instance)\nwill discharge 50-60% over a 3-5 month period of time. Non-sealed cells\nself discharge even faster.

Furthermore it is very silly to \nstore the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to \ncontact the ballast. \n\nSeriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary \ngreatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in \nfact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full \ncharge for > 2 years so it must be possible.\n\nIf your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above \nfreezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a \nmonth?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, \nDON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).\n\nAnouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like \nelectric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep \ndischarged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance \nautomotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure \nshortly afterwards but modern ones are superb.

(I.e., run by microcontrollers?)  The\neasiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the\nboards is talking to the PC.  When this line was true, the other boards\ncould all hold off and not send their data.  This isn't a perfect solution,\nthough, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't\ndecide to talk at the _exact same time_.\n\nOther than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to \"something\"\nthat speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it\nused to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPS\nor slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex\nthe data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first\nparagraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more\nthan 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to be\nable to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)\n\nYou might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC,\nthough.  I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports, 4\nRS-232 ports) for a very reasonable $85.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad",

(How the VCR or TV reacts to \nthis signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision \ncopy protection.)\n\nIn order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry \nof its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow \nmagically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The \ncircuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.\n\nIt is a pretty lame scare tactic.

So no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  It's\nstandard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.\n\nAll the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables\nis rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,\nand throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in\nanother.

        "content": "I thought the first thread was hilarious, so here goes another post.\n\nSome more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.\n\n  One year, I left the batteries in the garage.  The garage is Unheated.  \nThey were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding\nlawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the \nriding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries \nwas new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered\nthat all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all\nworked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced \nabout halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored\nin the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)\n  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.\none is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and\ndiscovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries\ndead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said \"HMMMMMMMM\" and \nthe amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)\nthe internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They\nwere the same.  \n   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead\nacid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only\nneeded a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them\nby using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they\nworked fine for around 25 of 'em. \n  This leads me to believe one of several things.\n     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)\n     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the\n        batteries.\n     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the \n          room where the concrete is, \n     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air\n         better than concrete.\n\n(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)  \n\n   Any other ideas?\n    *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*",

So many companies will purchase a few copies of a\nsoftware package and then employees will internally distribute them as if they\nowned a site-license!  What do you guys think?",

I got my\nfirst one in college about 5 or so years ago.\n\n\tI've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for\npast 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I\ngot software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister\nand father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go\nfor one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's).\nThe original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would\nsay that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one\n(small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.\n\n\tMy brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it\nto him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief\nadvantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:\n\nAdvantages:\tQuick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's\nprinting), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't,\nso look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet\nAppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one\nDW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to\ncolor or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I\nreceived many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp\nlaser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those\nImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25\nper sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all\nhours of the night....)\n\nDisadvantages.\tInk used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and\nwasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink\n(I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and\nrunning (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your\nbookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts\n(I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to\n$12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but\nI don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of\nabout 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after\nfooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing\ndoesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the\npaper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine.\nOther disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in\nspeed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press\nsoftware solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but\nthey won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.\n\nIn the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript\n(unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even\nwhen soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only\ninstance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board\nTransparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser\nPostscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB\nnegatives directly onto a transparency.\n\nWell, hope my babbling has helped.\n-squish@endor.harvard.edu",

They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in\nquantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info\nabout simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest\nMims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with\nresistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math\nto get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a\n555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate\ndoing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz\nto about 500 KHz (I think).\n\nAbout the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to\nuse one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio\nline (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise.\n\nThe data line is probably most easily done\nby some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565\nchip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing\nabout how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp\ninformation can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack\ninfo-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with.\nSetting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I\nwould suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is\ngoing into, so I am really generalizing...\n\nAs for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I\nsuggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would\nbe the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making.\nHope that clears things......\n\n-squish@endor.harvard.edu",

(I am almost\nsure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be\nwrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel\nlike thinking through it right now.)\n \nWhat is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,\nis exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes\n(acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals\nmay form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.\nThe reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery\ncharger) is put back into the battery.\n \nLead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each\ncell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts\n(terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric\nenergy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it\nhas a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So\nwhile keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.\n \nTo understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on\nconcrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's\nPrinciple, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will\nact to move to a more comfortable position.  Here are the thermal conductivities\nof a some selected materials:\n \n                                              thermal conductivity\n       material           Temperature, C (F)  BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft)\n       --------           ------------------  --------------------\ndiatomaceous earth,            204                   0.051\n natural, across strata        871                   0.077\ndiatomaceous, natural,         204                   0.081\n parallel to strata            871                   0.106\ndiatomaceous earth powder     (100)                  0.039\n  (density, 18 lb/cu.ft)      (200)                  0.042\n                              (300)                  0.044\n                              (400)                  0.048\n                              (500)                  0.051\nconcrete (cinder)              ---                   0.20\n         (stone)               ---                   0.54\n         (1:4 dry)             ---                   0.44\npine (across grain)             15                   0.087\n   (parallel to grain)          21                   0.20\noak (across grain)              15                   0.12\nmaple (across grain)            50                   0.11\n \nNote that the thermal conductivity for \"dirt\" (diatomaceous earth) goes down\nwith temperature.  Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder\nare on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivity\nof concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4\ntimes greater than wood.\n \nIt is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on\nconcrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the\ndischarge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity\nor heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).)\nDuring storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on\nthe battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity\nsurface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity\nsurface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom\nsurface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,\nthe battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster\nthan that on dirt.\n \nThis is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play.  Removing energy from\nthe exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the\nreaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that\ntemperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is\na better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner\nof a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which\n\"pulls\" the reaction along.\n \nAlso, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric\nacid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.\n \nJeff White      jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu\n \n\"How do I get the ketchup out of my pocket protector?\"  French fries!",

Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope),\nbut then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS\ninformation is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS\nmanufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the\nmotherboard.

        "content": "There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers\navailable from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and\npossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with\nrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right\nside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a\ngray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow\nyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information\npackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a\ncoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new\ncapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find\nthat the cartidges now last longer.\n\nI don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your\nnearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.\n\nHP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical\ncomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer and\nthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original\ndesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are\nlikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new\ndeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an\noriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no\nsoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping\nthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP\nservice center for further information.\n\nThe PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from\nthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser\nprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a\nraster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material\ndifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the\naccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously\nslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are\nstill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect\nworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\n\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\n\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\n\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\nproblem.\n\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\nlaserjet IV.\n\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\n\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\n\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.\n\n\n-- \nBill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department\nRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511\nwtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED",

If they ever\ndo get as efficient and cost effective as red and green LEDs, you're probably\ngoing to see a whole new family of color displays.\n\n         Charlie Brett - Ft. Collins, CO",

If you got a fibreglass\nboard with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour.\nTeflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.\n\nI'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green, so they're\nnot about to change.

        "content": ">The lead-acid secondary cell releases energy (electricity) with the following\n>chemical reaction:\n> \n>Pb + PbO2 + 2H2SO4 --> 2PbSO4 + 2H20\n> \n>Lead and Lead (IV) Oxide and Sulfuric Acid produce Lead Sulfate and Water\n[heats of formation deleted]\n>The heat of reaction at 25 C is therefore -60.6 kcal per mole PbSO4 produced.\n>Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water\n>at 25 C), and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is\n>occurring, or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery.  (I am almost\n>sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be\n>wrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel\n>like thinking through it right now.)\n\nThe major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution.\nPbSO4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  Also, H2SO4\nis in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of\nPbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.\n\n>What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,\n>is exothermic, or energy discharging.\n\nAs it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).\n(More about this later.)\n\nWhat actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:\n(we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)\nThe battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things\nhappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead\n           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).\n        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution\n           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).\nNow, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate\nin a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)\nwe end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4\nforms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this\nhappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).\n\nThe precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If\nthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate\n(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.\n\nI have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they\nare for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore\nthe lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with\nthese products for a newer battery.\n\n[stuff deleted]\n>To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on\n>concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's\n>Principle, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will\n>act to move to a more comfortable position.

A concrete surface is\n>a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner\n>of a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which\n>\"pulls\" the reaction along.\n\nThis stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid.\nIn fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher\ntemperatures.  A logical consequence of the above argument is this:\n\"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to\n -50 to 'pull' the reaction along.\"  We all know from experience (at\n least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is\nnot true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm\nthe battery.\n\n(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge\n to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any\n such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This\n is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool\n during storage.)\n\nJust keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged!",

I'm making a 7 stepper controller board, \nwith 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.\n   One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is \nbi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  Look for a chip \nnumbered 74LS245.  If you don't have this, then it's probably a 74LS244, \nwhich will do you NO good for reading in.\n  \n          Now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:\n  First, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.\n  In pascal, you would \"Write(Port[xxx]);\" where xxx is the address in \neither hex or decimal.  The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the \nstrobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, \nso for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  You can also output \nto these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  In pascal, \ndo \"Port[xxx]:=value\n\".\n \n                Hope this helps.\n        Let me know if you need more help.\n \n \n  _________________________________________________\n  Inspiration  |   ___                             |\n  comes to     |  \\   o  baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca |\n  those who    | (  ^  ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca |\n  seek the     |   /-\\      =] Baden de Bari [=    |\n  unknown.     |                                   |\n  -------------------------------------------------",

One application is soldering\nto the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These\nwere notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.\nIf you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver\noff of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated\nsolution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be\ndisolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts\nare quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.\n--\n-->>>>>>>>>> Peter Reilley ..... pvr@wiis.wang.com .....

The 87 would be\njust about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale; I\ndidn't feel it was worth the extra $100 for a second 8060 since I\ndon't use dB all that much in my work.\n\n-- \nBill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department\nRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511\nwtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED",

Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the\nlong cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  I\nwould suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short\npeaks.\n\nYou can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or try\nstrapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out,\nwhich will minimize the line drop.  If these don't work, though, you're\ngoing to need a bigger generator.\n\nI assume that you're using well-maintained generators, and have watched the\nvoltage output on the generator properly.  If you don't have 120V coming out\nof the unloaded generator you'll never get 120V at the other end.\n\n>Can anyone offer any advice?
