        "content": "I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having\n osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his\n illness is the rare Gaucher's disease. \n\nGaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 \n inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal\n bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is\n attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the\n enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.\n This will eventually cause death.\n\nEnyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and\n approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients\n administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable\n improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured\n by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000\n per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called \"the most\n expensive disease in the world\".\n\nNEED INFO:\nI have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying\n on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:\n**news, stories, reports\n**people you know with this disease\n**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of\n   enough money to buy some, programs available to help with\n   costs.\n**Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER\n\nThanks so very much!\n\nDeborah"

And, much as it discomforts us, in\nhumans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and\ncranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.\nDomestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:\nmy family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-\ngrandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife\nhad each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-\ngrandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous\nfarmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of\nchildbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,\ncontain quite a few gravestones like \"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and\nbaby, May 6, 1853.\"\n\n>You wanted\n>to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a\n>thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage,\n\nMore like one in ten.

But it is often fatal, when it happens out of\nreach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.\n\nClearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine\ndesign); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.  \n\n>You have your kids where you want. You encourage your wife to\n>get six inch holes cut through her stomach muscles, expose herself\n>to anesthesia and infection, and whatever other \"just in case\" measures\n>you think are necessary.\n\nMy, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack\nin months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.\n\nWe're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although\nI can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked\nthem up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.\nI wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly\nindicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting\nuntil an emergency to give in.\n\nAnd bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.\nWe talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main\ndecisions were really hers.\n\n>But I for one am bothered by your continued\n>suggestions, especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first\n>time, that birth is dangerous, even fatal, and that all these\n>unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing\n>it naturally.\n\nI don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that\na first-time mother should have her baby at home.\n\n>I'm no Luddite.

As I understand, these are all short term.\n\nI second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say\nwhat type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say\nhow long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for\nmonths before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are \nevery other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.\nAnother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start\nazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug\nin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics\nabout options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of \ndisease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it\nis worth.  \n\nI treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good \npatient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things\ncan be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and\nColitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637\ninfo hotline.\n\nBest of Luck to you.\n\nSteve Holland.\ngila005@uabdpo.dpo.uab.edu"

The second question is something that's been\nknown for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting\nsmoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the\nperson who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the\ninterim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per\nday for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still\nrather low overall, but significant.

If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a\npatient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear\nwhat your magic is.\n\nEvery once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.\nMind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,\nbut the patient feels like \"something is being done\" (as if the\nhours I spent talking with and examining the patient were\n\"nothing\"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper\nthan CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.\n---\n .

Other\ntherapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol\nwork better in migraine than tension-type headache.\n\nThe most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got\nrelief.

        "content": "I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,\n(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\nI generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\nonly \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have\nany more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\nto have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \nlegs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\nI'm frequently in severe pain.\n\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\n(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\n\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd \nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\n\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because\nI have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\nbut I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\na reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\nI can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\nI've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\nI reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\nthey either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?\nMy doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\npain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\nsuccinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.\n\nAnyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\n\nJanice Rathmann"

Very little acne as a teenager. I\ndidn't have any luck with clearasil.

I notice grease \non my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating\nmeat).\n\nKeeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm\nwater bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will\nhelp prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it\nsoftens and washes off when it has a chance.

        "content": "I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of\nmite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot\nof time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years\n(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from\npainful experience:\n\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\n\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\n     that these things will itch for months.\n\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\n     required to get it.\n\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.\n-- \nGary H.

All too many patients read the insert and panic and then\non the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug\nand we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably\ndidn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit\nthey wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or\nsomething.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they\nreport every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating\nthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough\nliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to\nhappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information\non a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the\nAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.\nThere are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.\nPatients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks\nto themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to \"go ballistic\",\nbut so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been\nreported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume\nit could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will\nrefuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for\nPDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with\ntools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.\nI am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the\ndomain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions\nabout migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.\nFor common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help\nquite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the\ncomputer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,\nphysicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,\nas is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked\nthings that the patients should have found out from their physician\nbut didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.\nSometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to\nask the system, we hope.\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | \"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\" \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Squeeze the juice from \n          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and \n          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  \n          Drink one glass per hour.\n          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day \n          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH \n          PULP.] \n               6th day: Same as 5th day. \n               7th day: Same as 6th day. \n               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each \n          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, \n          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n\n          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. \n               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to \n          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the \n          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n      \n          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.\n               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple \n          cider \"flavored\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a \n          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  \n          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a \n          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal \n          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially \n          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a \n          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. \n        \n          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]\n               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level \n          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  \n          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely \n          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt \n          (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. \n               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising \n          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your \n          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, \n          chomping your teeth together, etc.. \n               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes \n          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the \n          book \"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\", by Frances Nixon, 1973. \n               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should \n          prepare it and drain it.\n          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away \n          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly \n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \n          other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \n          a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an \n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" \n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".]\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \n          \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published \n          bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the \n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \n          present at those times).\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \n       \n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \n       \n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \n               about 2 months. \n        \n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \n\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \n               day.\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \n\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \n               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST \n               \"A.I.D.S.\", which is really a form of cancer similar to \n               leukemia.]  (See the book \"Life Extension\", by Durk \n               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) \n\n               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \n               several times per day.\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \n               described above. \n\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \n\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \n               magnetic fields. \n\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \n               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics \n               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos \n               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! \n\n               INTERFERON tablets.\n\n               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). \n           \n               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical \n               problems (even drug addiction!). \n\n               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure \n               prostate trouble. \n\n               This list is NOT exhaustive. \n\n\n          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-\n          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent \n          and cure many other medical problems including heart-\n          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work \n          effectively. \n\n          Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these \n          remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send \n          a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it \n          to CURE the cancer. \n\n          In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, \n          then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies \n          described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast), \n          BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations \n          and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer \n          treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!]. \n          \n          \n          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources \n          that have shown themselves to be reliable.

I still believe\nthat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would\nnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent\nthe many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.\nAnd 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that \nwould help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank\ngoodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine\nthat helps me.  \n\nI think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you\nwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second\nopinion, and then move on with your life.\nJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in \nthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.\nThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over\nthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going\nto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was \nhelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very\nunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,\nmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.\n\nA recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what\nI'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not\na put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are\nonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us\nout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing\npiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\n\nI guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things\nthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,\nor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because \nthose things are much more tangible and have much more concise \ndefinitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to\ndecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to\nfind your way out of it.\n\n\nI have chosen the latter.\n\n\nLinda\nlindae@netcom.netcom.com\n\n\n>\n>-- \n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\n>geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\" \n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n        2. X terminals\n        3. NeXT\n        4. Silicon Graphics\n        5. IBM RS/6000\n\t6. Other stuff\n\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n\n\tIf you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\n\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding\n\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\n\truns the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\n\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\n\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\n\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\n\n\tThe two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.\n\n\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\n\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\n\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\n\tserver can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings\n\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,\n\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\n\tor bugging your vendor.\n\n\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\n\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.\n\n\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\n\n    2. X terminals\n\n\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\n\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\n\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\n\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\n\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\n\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\n\n    3. NeXT\n\n\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\n\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\n\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\n\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\n\n    4. Silicon Graphics\n\n\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\n\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't\n\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not\n\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\n\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\n\tdetails.\n\n    5. IBM RS/6000\n\n\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\n\tUnfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\n\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\n\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\n\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\n\tworks.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||\n\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\n\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\t\t\t\t    ||\n    \n    6. Other stuff\n\n\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\n\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\n\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\n\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\n\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\n\tluck.

The\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\n\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\n\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\n\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from\n    TidBITS available there.\n\n\nFlexPro Keyboard\n    Key Tronic\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\n\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\n    Price: $489 (?)\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\n\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's\n    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both\n    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.\n    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.\n\n    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will\n    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.\n\n\nDragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)\n    Dragon Systems, Inc.\n    320 Nevada Street\n    Newton, MA  02160\n\n    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200\n    Fax: 617-527-0372\n\n    Shipping: Now.\n\n    Price: DragonDictate-30K -- $4995 (end user system)\n\t   DragonWriter 1000 -- $1595 / $2495 (end user/developer system)\n\t   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.\n    \n    Compatibility: 386 (or higher) PC only\n\t\t   (3rd party support for Mac)\n\n\tFree software support for X windows is also available -- your\n\tPC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a\n\tserial cable or network.

You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.\n    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between\n    words.

You can rearrange the three\n    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).

The better ones also include\nadvice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to\n \nwarn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.\n\nOften, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has\na delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing\nall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.\nThese tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their\nwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your \nbody to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.\n\n \n    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tBright Star\n\tTel: +1 (206) 451 3697\n    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows\n    Description:\n\tProvides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. \n\tWarns when to take a break (configurable).

Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work\n\tyou do - data entry, word processing, information processing.\n\tExercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on\n\thow to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.\n\n\tCHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use \n\tto learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information\n\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\n\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\n\n\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\n\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\n\tuseful when used with Windows.\n\n\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\n\n    Comments:\n\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\n\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\n\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff\n\tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers,\n\tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company \n\tto pay up for RSI management tools.  \n\n    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tRAN Enterprises\n\tOne Woodland Park Dr.\n\tHaverhill, MA  01830, US\n\tTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times).

Also includes online help \n\ton workplace ergonomics.  \n\n\tQuote from their literature:\n\n\t\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic\n\tsets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work\n\tall parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent\n\tRepetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve\n\tyour peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these\n\thelp you to become more relaxed and productive.\"\n \n\t\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.\n\tGodnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup\n\tfor a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to\n\tpromote healthy and efficient computer use. \n\t\n\tCost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts\n\tfor resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).\n \n    Comments:\n\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\n\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\n\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\n\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\n\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\n\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\n\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\n\tone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not\n\trequire any sound hardware.\n\n    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tVisionary Software\n\tP.O.

Its user interface\n\tdesign is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.\n\texpensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only\n\ttool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it\n\ton your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!\n\tDoes not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does \n\thave the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,\n\twhich is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.\n\n    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)\n    Available from:\n\tEmail to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)\n    Description:\n\tThis is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you\n\tto stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously\n\ttyping.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n\tcan start typing again.  \n\n\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n\tfeedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so\n\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n\tfor the next appointment.\n\n\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n\tfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with\n\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n\twith RSI exercises.\n\n\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\n\n\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n\tyourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI \n\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n\tmanually or automatically.  \n\n\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n\tare doing.\n\t\n    Comments:\n\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\n\twarning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)\n    Description:\n\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n\tOnly works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\n\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \n\n-- \nDan Wallach               \"One of the most attractive features of a Connection\ndwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces\nOffice#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet.\" -- CM Paris Ref.

What was the methodology of Darwin?  What\nwas the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the\nmethodology of Jenner and Pasteur?  \n\n\nIn an earlier article, Russell Turpin writes:  \n\n>None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should\n>open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science.\n>Modern advocates of homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional\n>Chinese medicine receive little respect because, for the most\n>part, they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research\n>Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty.  (This does\n>*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does*\n>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are\n>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and\n>which are not.)\n\nFirst of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I\ndon't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,\nhomeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be\naccepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of\nhomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  \n\nWhat some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things\n(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific\nattention.  \n\nIf in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not\nuse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is\neffective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all\nof current science is based on the past work of scientists whose\nmethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  \n\nIt is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine\nthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is\nalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on \nthose early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous \nfashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  \n\nBut to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is\ncapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no\nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly\nbe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as\ndoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in\nreason.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

As soon as you possibly can.  The\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\nthese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\n\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\na wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\".\n\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):\n(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\n\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\n\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\nconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\ntenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \"the problem.\"\n\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.\n\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\nthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,\nyou're completely restricting your blood flow.\n\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\nand the cycle continues.\n\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\n\nAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\nergonomics, only make things worse.\n\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\ninflamed, and you've got your problem.\n\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\nwith repetitive activity.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\n\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\n\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\n\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\nIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\nthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\ncalm down, and relax.\n\nIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\n\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best\nfor you.\n\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\n\n. Let your shoulders relax.\n. Let your elbows swing free.\n. Keep your wrists straight.\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\n. Don't slouch or slump forward.\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\n\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\n\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\nfootrest.\n\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\narea.\n\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\n\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\n\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\nname says it all.\n\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\n\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\nshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\ndeviated hands.\n\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\n\n==5== Requests for more info\n\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\nis incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.\n\nIf you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\nwonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the\nabove sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.\n\n==6== References\n\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

But there is nothing objective about the\n*process* of science.  \n\nIf good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\nto homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\nBut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This\nis where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one\nmust have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere\ncollection of empirically validated random hypotheses.\n\nExperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but\nthey are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most\nimportant part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.  \nWithout this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No,\nhypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.\nNor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or\nlooking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really\ngood thinking beforehand.)  \n\nThe difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre\nscientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.  \nIt depends on the quality of their THINKING.  \n\nIt really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that\nthey are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical\nstudies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as\ncertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, \nbut mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  \n\nAnd I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that\nscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding\nmistakes doesn't get you anywhere.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced\na seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted\nFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like\nthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the\nfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision\nwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.\n\nWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had\na bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am\nembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once\nin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \"Oh, oh, this is the\nsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\"  Ten \nminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure\nto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.\n\nWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for\nthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now\nafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even\nhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I\nunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.\n\nOnce again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good\nto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any\nexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical\ncommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and\nfoods play in our general health and well-being.

The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the \"Newton of mirror-image life,\" which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

The 1986 Safe\nDrinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either\nfilter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use\nfrom pollution,\" Olson continued.  Some systems are moving\ntowards eventually implementing filtration systems but are\nexpected to miss the law's deadline.\n   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already\na reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface\nwater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent\nof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism\ncryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite\ncalled giardia.\n   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office\nstudy released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee\nChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the\nnation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary\nsurveys of water systems.\n   \"This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions\nof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be\nassured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately\nput into place programs to protect water sources from\ncontamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment\nmust be installed to protect the public,\" Olson noted.  \"The time\nhas come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop\ndragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from\ncontamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs\nneeded to assure their water is safe to drink.\"\n   NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.\n\n   Systems EPA Indicates Require Filtration and Do Not Adequately\nProtect Watersheds\n\n CONNECTICUT\n\n Bridgeport            Bridgeport Hydraulic Co.\n\n MASSACHUSETTS\n Boston                H2O Resource Author (MWRA)\n Medford               MWRA-Medford Water Dept\n Melrose               MWRA-Melrose Water Dept\n Hilton                MWRA-Hilton Water Dept\n Needham               MWRA-Needham Water Division\n Newtoncenter          MWRA-Newton Water Dept.\n Marblehead            MWRA-Marblehead Water Dept\n Quincy                MWRA-Quincy Water Dept\n Norwood               MWRA-Norwood Water Dept\n Framingham            MWRA-Framingham Water Div\n Cambridge             MWRA-Cambridge Water Dept\n Canton                MWRA-Canton Water Div-DPW\n Chelsea               MWRA-Chelsea Water Dept\n Everett               MWRA-Everett Water Dept\n Lexington             MWRA-201 Bedford (PUO WRKS)\n Lynn                  MWRA-Lynn Water & Sewer Co\n Malden                MWRA-Malden Water Division\n Revere                MWRA-Revere Water Dept\n Woburn                MWRA-Woburn Water Dept\n Swampscott            MWRA-Swampscott Water Dept\n Saugus                MWRA-Saugus Water Dept\n Somerville            MWRA-Somerville Water Dept\n Stoneman              MWRA-Stoneman Water Dept\n Brookline             MWRA-Brookline Water Dept\n Wakefield             MWRA-Same as Above\n Waltham               MWRA-Waltham Water Division\n Watertown             MWRA-Watertown Water Division\n Weston                MWRA-Weston Water Dept\n Dedham                MWRA-Dedham-Westwood District\n Winchester            MWRA-Winchester Water & Sewer\n Winthrop              MWRA-Winthrop Water Dept\n Boston                MWRA-Boston Water & Sewer Co\n S.

Simply avoiding\n> mistakes doesn't get you anywhere.  \n\nI think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes.\nAbove, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great\nscience that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre\nscience that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\nwhat is not. \n\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\ndo this.  \n\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \n\n> If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\n> to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\n> But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This\n> is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  \n\nI have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered \nscientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,\nnot just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect\nthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;\nwhat it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the\npresence of qi.\n\n> ... In order to have science, one must have a theoretical\n> structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically\n> validated random hypotheses.\n\nCertainly a \"theoretical structure that makes sense\" is the goal.\nIn areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with\nforming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\nclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to\nplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \n\nRussell"

Such \"extra-\n>rational\" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

        "content": "Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also \nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\nIn article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com \n    (Dick King) writes:\n>  [ Somebody writes: ]\n>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....\n>  ....\n>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a\n>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.\n>         ....\n>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out\n>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it's not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\"\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's\nassertion that current scientific methods \"avoid all known errors.\")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

Try tanking up before\nplaying rather than after.\n\nBeing in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.\n\nI've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in \ndescending order of importance):\n\n1) Heavy exercise\n2) Sleep deprivation\n3) Fasting\t\t(e.g., skipped breakfast)\n4) Physical trauma\t(e.g., head bonk)\n\nHeavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I \ndon't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of \nthe other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered \nthis, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two \nor three years when I get cocky (\"It's been so long, maybe I just don't \nget them anymore\") and stop being careful.\n\nHope this is helpful.\n\nJohn."

The psoriasis is under\ncontrol but the arthritis part of the illness is not.\n\nAnsaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but\nisn't helping much now.

Staying in\none position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that\ntendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of\nthe palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is\nquite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment\nto relieve it.\n\nThe latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is\nnow recommending Prednisone.

Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?\n\nAlso, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of\nonly about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to\n95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar\nwith the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not\nbe understanding all of the differences.\n\nIn the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than\nwith glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the\nintentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when\nnecessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It\nis important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other\nconsequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an\nexcitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate\nis essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain\n(humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown\noff.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in\nsmall amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts\nadded by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be\nencountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food,\npackaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your\nblood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these\ncompounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects. \nRead Olney's review paper in Prog.

I've known a lot of scientists\nwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit\nout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.\n\n(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\nelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\nhe'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\n\n>It further at least implicitly advances the position that\n>sciences goes \"forward\" (and it is not clear what this means given the\n>context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\n>and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\n>weeded out via the \"critical function\" of science.\n\nI'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\n\n>(Though why this critical\n>function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\nLysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\n\n>If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\n>subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\n>of the application of any \"critical function\" concerning replication.\n>This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \"anything goes\" view.)\n\nI don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\nculture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is\n>*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have\n>resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply\n>do not generalize well to the actual history of science.\n\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps\nyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out\nfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first\nadvanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from\nmodern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\n-- \nMark A.

PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the\ncornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't\ncut in PRK, it vaporizes.

I \nthen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he\nhad more time.  He responded, \"Just spit it out now because no time is\na good time.\"  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and\ntried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my\nnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered\nand then said \"well, never mind\" and he said he'll talk to various\ncolleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time.\n\nThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express\nmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\naddress below.  \nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\n\n\n\n  \n\n#######################################################################\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\n#######################################################################\n\n\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

Reproduced without permission.]\n\n\n\nDigression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors\n\nAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically\ntasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\nsour as well.\n\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\n\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted\nextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to\nchronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is\nsomething to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much\nmore frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an\nautimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which\nalso leads to cirrhosis.  \n\nOf course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous\neffects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. \nPatients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,\namong many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic\ncirculation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of\nhyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. \nThese effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in\nmen, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for\ncirrhosis is liver transplant.\n\nKeep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in\nyour friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the\nsubject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he\nor she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to\nyou, and offer you support.\n\nSimon."

Biomedical research doesn't make any basic \nassumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific\nresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis\nand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than \n\"the old Newtonian model of the world\".  And I doubt that many psychologists\nwould appreciate being put outside this empirical \"world view\".  Psychology\nalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. \n\n>It is also important to distinguish reason from science.

Aristotle reasoned\n>that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle. \n\nOversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-\ntion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually \nfound wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will \nhave continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  \nThere's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of\nknowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own \ndiscipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,\neven idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come\nto these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had \na vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and \ntested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting\nscience and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a \ncreative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally\nturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  \n\nAgain, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by \"science\".  I often\ndon't recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way science\nis portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They\nportray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTH\nin big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab,\nturn over a stone, and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula-\ntion.  Its much more interesting than that.  It really is a very human\nprocess."

The\narcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions\nare particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the\nblood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin,\nwhich controls the release and flux of steroids governing development,\nespecially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less\nsensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu,\non a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood\nlevels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release\nof steroids becomes flattened.\n\n                    Hope this helps.\n                    --Dianne Murray: wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca"

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,\nI only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I\nestimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.\n\nVery little sugar or salt.\n\nVery high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are\nrecommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard\nof people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can\ncontain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as\nlikely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are\njust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)\n\nMy \"clean your plate\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last\n10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch\nup, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.\n\nI don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry\nshortly, and eating won't be practical then).\n\nI bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to\nstores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.\nI estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps\nbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes\nruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my\nmetabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable\nwith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if\nit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess\nounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that\nweigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim\nweight from the rider than from the vehicle.)\n\nThere's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically\ndifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,\nit isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.\n\nObviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've\ndone will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who\ndid try it and didn't succeed.\n\n> I think all of us cycle.  One's success depends on how large the\n> fluctuations in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.\n\nI'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.\nI usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,\nmy weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes\noff again over a week or two.\n-- \nKeith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\n\nf p=2,3:2 s q=1 x \"f f=3:2 q:f*f>p!'q  s q=p#f\" w:q p,?$x\\8+1*8"

Dr. Teperman \ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our \nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \nDr. Teperman. \n\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\n\n\nLAST MEETING\n\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \nher for an entertaining evening.\n\n\n\nANNUAL MEETING\n\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \nslate for the Board.\n\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\n\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\n\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\n\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \nmembers and there is plenty of work. \n\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\n\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\n\nFUTURE MEETINGS\n\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \n\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\n\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \n\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\n\nNOTDAW\n\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \n\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\n\nDR. STARZL TO BE HONORED \n\nThe Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will \nhold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the \nFountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas \nStarzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and \nare going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne \nTreffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.\n\nMEMBERSHIP NEWS \n\nCongratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant \nin Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing \nwell after only 12 days in hospital.\n\nArthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston \nMarathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation \nworks!  We hope the national press notices. \n     \nBob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his \ntransplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis \nand feeling better.  \n\nNicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, \nspent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems \nencountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  \nThey are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will \ncontinue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. \n\nKay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall \nthat resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a \ncandidate for the Board so we need her well soon.\n \nAnd best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough \nwinter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.\n\nSEE YOU......WEDNESDAY   APRIL 14  8 PM   K of C UNIONDALE            \n                   DR. LEWIS TEPERMAN"

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of\naspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise,\nsince you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other\ncomponents of food all the time.  In studies involving administration\nof high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable.\nMethanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings,\nsay 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde\nand formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels\ncan damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses\nthe body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one\ntreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on\nethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is\nmetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver.\nIf the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde,\nit is actually relatively non-toxic.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer"

(To\n>reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from\n>uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical\n>problems are notoriously problematic.)  \n\nOkay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\n\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \n\n\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\nhasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\nresearch then it can't be of any interest to us.\"  \n\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There've got to\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\n\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most \nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \nit doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\nprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to\npractice it over again at home.\n\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \n\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \nfrom scientific acceptance.) \n\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don't have any way of \nknowing that it's effective.\"  \n\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't \nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of \nbooks and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \ndetail as I'm capable of.)  \n\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \nfavorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\n\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \nattitudes about science.  \n\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \nIf so, I apologize. \n \n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

        "content": "This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he\nsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique\nI'd never seen before.\n\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\n\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\n\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\n\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\nand concerns me are:\n\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\n\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\n\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\n    so.\n\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\n\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\n\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\n\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.\n\nAn amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was\ndiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting\na lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.\nThis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.\nThe guy who represented the company in the press conference defended\nhimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day\nfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-\nbroiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my\nimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal\nbroiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!"

The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde\n>produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to\n>living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.  \n\n[...]\n\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\n\n   [Reproduced without permission]\n\n\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\n\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\n\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\n\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\n\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\n\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\n\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\n\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\n\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\n\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\n\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\n\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\n\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\n\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\n\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\n\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\n\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\n\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\n\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\n\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\n\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\n\n\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\n\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\n\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\n\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\n\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\n\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\n\tafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm\n\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the\n\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\n\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association's\n\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\n\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\n\tclean bill of health.\n\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\n\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\n\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\n\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\n\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\n\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\n\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\n\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\n\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\n\tof selected foods omitted]\n\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\n\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\n\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\n\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\n\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\n\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\n\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\n\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\n\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\n\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\n\n\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)"

        "content": "KS> From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart)\nKS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome\nKS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg\nKS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information\n\nI'm not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\n\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\n\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\n\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\n\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\nyears.\n\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\nneuropsychologic tests.\n\nMy take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\nwithout PPS complaints).\n---\n .

We will \n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\n;No breeding, no \"hybrids\", etc.  The ethical question is, should\n;we?\n \nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \n1) reducing the gene pool and \n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\n \nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\ndon't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \n \nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\nas no different than anyone else's. But if we could make\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\n\"1984.\"   \n \nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\nhasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\nturns came.\n \nNot that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \n \nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\nmay not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\npull us through. \n \nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\nthus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough. \n \nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the\nSpirit.\n \nSorry for the long post. Got carried away.\n \nBob (ruegg@med.unc.edu)"

        "content": "In article <ls8lnvINNrtb@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu \n    (Russell Turpin) writes:\n>            ... \n>*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does*\n>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are\n>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and\n>which are not.)\n\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\nthere's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \n\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is \never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \n\n\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\n\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \n\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a \nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \nobjectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\n\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\ninvestigation.  \n\nIn article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: \n> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that\n> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  \n\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \nspecific question to try and answer.  \n\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \nI certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \nof \"reason and observation.\"\n\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \n\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \nis any existing research related to this question.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

        "content": "As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager \nI recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with \nthe results.  The catalog description is as follows:\n\n\tThe Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager \n\tthat actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a\n\tprofessional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two\n\tcounter-rotating \"thumbs\" that move in one-inch orbits --\n\treleasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.\n\n\tPressure Point Massager    A2623   $109\n\nTo order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or\nfax at 1-800-345-4021.\n\n********\nNOTE:\nWhen I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price\nwas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog\nenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  \nQUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,\nand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it\nlooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the\nfirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a\nreason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to\nship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could \nuse the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old \none.  VERY reasonable people.\n********\n\nI have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I \nwould be described as \"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches \nand exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  \nIf, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough\ntime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, \nmore prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require \nphysical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit \nto get the prescription for p.t.  \n\nThe tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache\n(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my \nphysical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles \nin particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the \nheadache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to \nwhile it is being massaged.\n\nI ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing\nsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my \nneck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in \nthe past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient \np.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up \nin the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.\n\nI have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base\nunit is about a 14\" x 9\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\" high, with handles on each\nside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \"thumbs\" are about \n1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs \nare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more \ntoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in \neither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side \nof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either\nside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck\nor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.\n\n\n                 _______________________________\n                |  __    _______________    __  |\n                | |  |  |\t\t|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |\t\t|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |\n                | |__|\t\t\t   |__| |\n                |_______________________________|\n\n\nFor the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if \nlaying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or \nneck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or\nstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are\nalso impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I \ndon't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works \nwell for me.\n\nFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager\nbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or\nnot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  \nIf I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches \nwhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use \nthan the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together \n(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and \nmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than \nnothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are \nnot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't \npin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this \nis to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple \nconsiderations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.\n\nNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion \nfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my\nneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard\nagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a\nfew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  \nAfter that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, \nthe pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  \nI also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the \nmost vulnerable point for me.\n\nIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,\nalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at\na time) to really work it out.\n\nI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I\ncannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had\nit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also \nto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have\nbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this \nwas very timely  for me.\n\nThis is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently\nbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been\nin business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,\nwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog\nproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought\nput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones\nI've seen such as \"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\" or \"Mature Wisdom\".\nI'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no\nbig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, \nparticularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.\n\nI apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would \nlike to know before ordering something thru the mail.\n\n\nRobin Coutellier                   \nNorthern Telecom, Mountain View, CA\nINTERNET: robin@ntmtv.com\nUUCP:portal!ntmtv!robin"

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by \nperforming studies that are \"blind\" in various ways.  Some of these\nare:\n\n  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a \n     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the\n     control group or the test group.\n\n  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects \n     receive a placebo or the test treatment.\n\n  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects\n     receive a placebo or the test treatment.\n\nObviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to \ndifferentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis\nis quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on\nwhich it is based so that others can verify it.  \n\nIt is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are\nanimals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because\nthose who performed the study did not \"blind\" themselves.  It is not\nconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already\nare, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,\nthe control and test groups are treated alike.\n\nRussell"

Children diagnosed with ADD\n   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and\n   social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents\n   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their\n   children's development.  So much for the value of \"interesting anecdotal\n   results\".

I don't think it\nis a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown\nany signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food.\nShe has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.\n\nThe fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made\nby Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to\nsomething in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in our\nimmediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, running\nnose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family history\nincluding some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms. \n\nAnyway, our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the body\nchemistry.

It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n\"mainly about.\"\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\n\n> Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \n> of certainty.

As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.

On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.

We're talking prudent policy in\n>infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.\n\nWho said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that\norally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all\nneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median\neminence. These areas are responsible for the production of\nhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal\ndevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now\nwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain\nnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?\nAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,\nANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for\ncontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? \n\nHow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to\n\"sacrifice\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\nindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine\nand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be\nuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on\npsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and\nphysiology.\n\nI suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities\n(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its\nimplication for adults (me).  Certainly\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\nendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*\nattained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. \n\n>>Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you\n>>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles\n>>disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever. \n>\n>You mean \"asserting\".

It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon\n>of the \"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\".  It says nothing about the frequent\n>inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.\n\nOlney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some\nsensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally\nadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone\nfluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant\nsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient\nrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is\nresponsible not only for control of growth during development, but\nalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of\nheadaches? I don't know.\n\n>>>dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com \n>>Hmm. \".com\".

They are very\nweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are\nbanned.\n\nThis also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a\ntime back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good,\nand never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned.\nThis is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.\n\nIf it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone\nwould do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates\nthat enforcement is still in effect.\n\nAn odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as \"gumbo file'\".\nThis is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This\nis not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its natural\nform, so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption\nwas made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats."

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32\nalternative health therapies.]\n\n  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the\n  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\n  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in\n  highly variable colour patterns.\n\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\n\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\n  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\n\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\n  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\n  the actual object itself.\n\n  [...]\n\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\n\n\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \"Reality shopping; a\nconsumer's guide to new age hokum.\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\nvNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for\nevaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples\nof hokum.]\n\n  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of\n  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian\n  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.\n  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings\n  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious \"auras\" or even\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,\n  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous\n  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of\n  the unknown.\n\n-- \nPeter Kaminski\nkaminski@netcom.com"

Hope you can join us.\n\n\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\n\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \nlifetime.  \n\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\n\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \nFoundation's mission is to change that. \n\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.

I was picked from\nmy softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)\nwhich put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get\nan equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To\ncontrol the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since\nI was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think\nI foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people\nlike me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are\nnot used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the\nresults of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major\nleague players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test\nwhether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was \"better\" -\nbut I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in\nsaid that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major\nleaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure\nwhether I'd believe her.)\n\nJanice Rathmann"

There\n>is a book \"The Yeast Connection\" which talks about this \"illness\".\n>\n>There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.\n\nThere's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and\npublished in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics\nwho quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.\n\nFor example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book \"Sinus Survival\", always gives,\nbefore any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his\nnew patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times\nin the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over \n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\nprogram.\n\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\nsymptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly \nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\n\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\nsorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\nsince that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\n\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\n\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\nto the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough\nactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my\nface that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee\ntheir safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as\nfar as I am concerned.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however.

In some circumstances, though, the    \norganisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    \nintestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the \ndisease is commonly called thrush.                                      \n  Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control     \npills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.   \nAmong narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve      \ninflammation.                                                           \n  Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood    \ntests.

After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\n\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides\n minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  \n\n My questions are: \n\n     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the\n     levels of pain?\n\n     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?\n\n     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?\n\n\n  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.\n  \n  \n  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.\n\n  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup\n  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.\n   \n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nGregory W.

Most early treatment of\nnon-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal\nevidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person,\nbut it's still no more than a guess.\nIt's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those\npeople who don't respond.\n\nThere are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many\ndiseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology\nsometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have\nrun out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental\nmethod they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine\ndoesn't have all the answers.\n\nThis person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a\nmiracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know?  \n\nYou might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparaging\nattack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for you\nr beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack.\n\n-Jackie-"

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some\n>claim their heart \"skipped\" beats once in a while.\n\nBoth of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed\nface is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular\npulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in\nthe blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are\nsodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,\none can get too much of a good thing.\n\n>Some reacted with headache, \n\nAgain, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased\nheart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,\nessentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency\nher, necessarily.\n\n\n>some stomach ache.\n\nWell stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not\nnecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting\noccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has\neaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the\nlist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an\nenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly\nache) would be expected.\n\n\n> Some had watery eyes or running nose,\n\n\nThese are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar\nto vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious\ncompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible\nsome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the\nsymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets\ncan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be\nnecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person\nwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration\nand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from\nsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.\n \n> some\n>had itchy skin or rashes. \n\nPeople respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends\nupon what it is about the compound that \"pisses off\" their body.\nPollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many\npeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an\nhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,\ncausing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an\nallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that\ncontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can\nperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. \n\n>More serious accusations include respiration \n>difficulty \n\nSee above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory\nproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.\n\nand brain damage. \n\nThe area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system\ncontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling\nthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,\nand other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.\n\n\n>Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one\n>suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food\npoisoning. \n\nAbsolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,\nsay, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus\ntoo much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,\nplus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days\nbefore from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of\nthings.\n\nBut it might be the MSG. \n\n>if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.\n\nIf noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably\nstomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.\n\n\nAnyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their\nresponses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\n\n          Dianne Murray  wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca"

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \n\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \ndiseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise \"disposable needlesused here.\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \nbeing poorly manufactured and too \"sharp\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to \"slide\" past vessels and            \nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that \nhaven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \n\nOf course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \nsite.\n\n\nWhile I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \n\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu"

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). \n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD, \nDenver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. \n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. \n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. \n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). \n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). \n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. \n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. \n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). \n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\n                           Management of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. \n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. \n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n\n---\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na"

Anthony Fauci, director of the \nU.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, \n\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly \ncan with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will \nget around microbial resistance.\"  He said any delay would signify questions \nover safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.

John Tew of the Medical College of \nVirginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument \nfor  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.

This finding \nsupports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of \ncontracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the \nJAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive \nsurgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies \nwere conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and \nFlorida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and \ntested all patients willing to participate.

A6 \n======================================================================   \n\"Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program\" AIDS \nTreatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) \n\n     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of \nHealth has raised questions about the NIH's commitment to an  effort that uses \nunorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the \nOffice time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much \nmore [than  public relations].\" \n======================================================================   \n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \n\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\n6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  \nfound that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, \nwhich is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nkill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 15, 1993 \n     ====================================================================   \n\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care \nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \nchange the future of worldwide health. \n====================================================================   \n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \n\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \nhas been the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\n                                H H S   N E W S\n     ********************************************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n                                March 29, 1993\n\n\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \n\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \n\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \n\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. \n\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \n\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \"We need this \ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \nHIV infection in children.\" \n\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \n\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \n\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \n\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \n\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. \n\n\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \nfevers, for example, than another,\" said Dr. McNamara.  \"We'll also look at \nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects.\"   He emphasized that the small \nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nproducts. \n\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \n\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \nprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \n\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \n\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \nconsidered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will \nbe told what they receive. \n\nIf the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the \nexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will \nbegin. \n\nEach child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six \nmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.  \n\nFor more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call \nthe AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service, 1-800-TRIALS-A, from 9 a.m. to 7 \np.m., EST weekdays.

Although the \nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' \nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \nitself caused the skin disease. \n\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \nRetroviruses. \n\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \n\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \n\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \nanimals. \n\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune \nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \n\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases. \n\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\n                                H H S   N E W S\n                 ********************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                                 March 4, 1993\n\n\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \ninfection or AIDS. \n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \nSan Francisco General Hospital. \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \nanswered as quickly as possible. \n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \nsources of information or materials. \n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \nmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. \n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health \nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA's associate \nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \"Providers who treat people with \nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\" \n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \n\n\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\n\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\n\f\n------------- cut here -----------------\n-- This is the last part ---------------\n\n---\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na"

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard\nScanjet IIp was purchased this week.\n\nThank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:\n\nJohn Sorenson\nCarol Sigelman\nCarla Moore\nBarbara Moose\nJudith Schrier\n\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\n\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \nreview the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted \ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \n\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \nprocessor formats.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3). \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated. \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset. \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children's Hospital and \nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases. \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3). \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6). \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

These finer particles are considered hazardous because \nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \n     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \nlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \nmicrogram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  \n     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory \nDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung \nAssociation's medical section.  \n     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study \nby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles \nmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \nOther studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \nand bronchitis in children.  \n     \"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\" \nsays Dr. Schwartz.  \"But more and more research is showing that particles are \nbad actors as well.\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate \nair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex \nand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nacid aerosols.  \n     \"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects \nof particulate air pollution,\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \"We have no way of \nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \" Consequently, most of what \nis known about particulates has been learned through population-based research \nlike the Seattle study.  \n     Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \ndioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any \ntime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with \nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.\n     \"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only \ncover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's \nrarely particulate matter,\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \"However, PM10 doesn't have \nto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma\n\nThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on \nDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in \ndermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance \ntechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care \nprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological \ncharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, \nand followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi \nand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in \npreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of \npresentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel \nweighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement. \n \nAmong their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a \ndistinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins; \n(2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential \nfor long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical \nexcision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and \nextensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4) \npatients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high \nrisk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely; \n(5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for \nmelanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education \nand screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality \nfrom melanoma. \n \nA copy of the full text of the consensus panel's statement is available by \ncalling the NIH Office of Medical Applications of Research at (301) 496-1143 \nor by writing to:  Office of Medical Applications of Research, National \nInstitutes of Health, Federal Building, Room 618, Bethesda, MD 20892.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 31\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                         NCI-Designated Cancer Centers\n\nThe Cancer Centers Program is comprised of 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers \nactively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer \nincidence, morbidity, and mortality.  Within the program, there are four types \nof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily \nin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on \nclinical research; \"comprehensive\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a \nmultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community \noutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer \nprevention and control research. \n \nAlthough some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was \nthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new \ncancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage \nof the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened \nthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and \ncancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew \nprogressively. \n \nIn 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, \nthere are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria \nfor comprehensive status. \n \nTo attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an \ninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly \nestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for \"comprehensiveness\" include the \nrequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in \nseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong \nprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings \ninto clinical practice. \n \nMoreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly \nbeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also \nreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting \nthe infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass \nstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, \nsignificant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important \noutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of \nsources. \n \nThe other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and \ncapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit \nimportant new findings or address timely research questions. \n \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nOf the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  \nThese centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers \nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory. \n \nClinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and \nclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently \nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \noverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. \n \nFinally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely \nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \ncontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public health \ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \nresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  \nConsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. \n \nTogether, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward \ncreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through \ninterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the \nlaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. \n \nComprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available) \n \nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center\nBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 108\n1918 University Boulevard\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\n(205) 934-6612\n \nUniversity of Arizona Cancer Center\n1501 North Campbell Avenue\nTucson, Arizona 85724\n(602) 626-6372\nInternet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edu\n \nJonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\n200 Medical Plaza\nLos Angeles, California 90027\n(213) 206-0278\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 33\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nInternet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edu\n \nKenneth T.

The \ndecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to \ntest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of \nHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  \nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the \ntherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies \nincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH \nthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is \nintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  \nreplication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's \nreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the \nMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  \n\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the \nnext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\" said Shalala.   \nAdministration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine \nHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had \nconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested \nsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of \nmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two \nyears.\n\n==================================================================    \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. \n114, No. 14, P. 18 \n\n     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, \nthe manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the \ndrug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that \nalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk \nof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  \ndisappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of \nthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the \ndrug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. \nresearchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, \nmany argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients \nexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  \nAIDS symptoms.

There do not\nseem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The\nCopenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF\nstudies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,\nbut like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.\n\nFrom one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in\nthe absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From\nanother (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of\nthe specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache,\ntherefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.\n\nWhether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling\nheadaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic\ncolleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients\nthey can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill\nmy office with patients holding their heads in pain.\n---\n . SLMR 2.1 . E-mail: jim.zisfein@factory.com (Jim Zisfein)"

This disease is \nuniversally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the \ntumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum \nmember checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.  \nHe spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from \nglioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had \naudited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.  \nAfter the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in \nSeptember, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his \noncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of \nshrinkage or necrosis.\n\nThe patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live \npast December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's \ntreatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's \ntreatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these \ntreatments, saying \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"\n\nDr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a \nprotein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it, \nand administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

That means at the\n*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage\nmanifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by\nneurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem\nwe have.

Dr. Noordewier has \nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \nto his current work in computational biology.\n\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\n\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \n National Laboratory) \n\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \ntechniques in this domain.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\n\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \nthe field.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\n\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \nare increasingly in evidence.

The critique comes from THE TUFTS\n   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]\n\n\t\"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November\n\t3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In\n\tthe segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley\n\tmakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them\n\t('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently\n\tsick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven\n\tpersonal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the\n\tsubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive \n\tthose studies are.\n\n\tConsider his making reference at the beginning of the program to\n\ta study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order\n\tto back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,\n\ta flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as\n\tin many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT\n\tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on\n\thumans but on rabbits.\n\n\tOne of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist\n\tPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that\n\ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get \n\theadaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably \n\toveremphasized the extent of the problem.'\n\n\tA second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor\n\tat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley\n\tremarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory\n\tanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because\n\tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's\n\tresearch with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human\n\tyoungsters.\n\n\tIn fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's \n\texperiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected\n\textremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing \n\ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,\n\tand when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance\n\tto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither\n\tof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG \n\twith food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by\n\tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little\n\treaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human\n\tblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations\n\tfound in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....\n\n\tThe World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of\n\tthat fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific\n\tCommittee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,\n\thave concluded that MSG is safe.\n\n\tTheir determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never\n\tbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed\n\tto it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a\n\tburning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe\n\tof clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently\n\texonerated the much-maligned substance.\n\n\tThat's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of\n\tmonosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever\n\twe eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one\n\tof the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken\n\tdown into glutamate during digestion.\n\n\tIt's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the\n\tmost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes\n\tup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in\n\tmilk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.\n\n\tThat doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number\n\tof people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore\n\tsensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international\n\tprofessional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus\n\treached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\"\n\n\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)"

Without knowing more it is not\npossible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring,\nor temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there are\nno dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate\nto obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on \nrecurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence from\nrecurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as \nrecurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the\nintestine.  \n\nYour friend should look into membership in the Crohn's and Colitis \nFoundation of America.   1-800-932-2423\n\nGood luck to your friend.\n\nSteve Holland"

These are the physicians \nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \nquack.  \n\nI've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I \nknow that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at \nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really \ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if \nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \nmedical profession.\n\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\nSteve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \nElaine's doctor a quack.\n\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \n\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \nit's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \nthe candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\nIf it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \nnondiscript.  \n\n\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving \norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \nantibiotics).  \n\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \nduring a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\n \nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out \ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\n\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin \nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved \nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \nseeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. \n \nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 West 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok. 74107\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\"."

I'm\ncertainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I\nagree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammation\ncan be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.\n\nHaving had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough\ncaveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically,\nthe idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be\nrealized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds\nof inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.\nTherefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common\ninflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's,\nof the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:\n\nCompletely out - never again - items:\n\to corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)\n\to popcorn (same)\n\to dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins\n\to nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)\n\nDiscouraged greatly:\n\to raw vegetables (too fibrous)\n\to wheat and raw grain breads\n\to exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)\n\to greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)\n\to little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!)\n\to long grain and wild rice (husky)\n\to beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)\n\to BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing\n\nI was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this\nday and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your\nsystem as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the\nNUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try\nthe ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it again!\nRemember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the\ndaylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more\nthoroughly - you're mileage may vary.\n\nAs with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.

Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\n\n\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\n\n\nIn article banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu writes:\n\n>I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\n>Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \n>Med.

Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible, Steve, and I \n>see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er's?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've\nknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \n>no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \n>balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...  Could it just be\n>professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.\n\nYou've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n>...Humans have all \n>kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small \n>and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.

But any of \n>these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \n>residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \n>happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\n\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \n>Elaine's doctor a quack.\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \n>the candida or not isn't certain.\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \n>nondescript.  \n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt's a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \n>ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \n>they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".

While this low level of vitamin \n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nAren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \n>inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \n>antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \n>just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \n>vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It's like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nAlso, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.

When I finally find a \n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \"live with\nit\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \"you'll just have\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:\n\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

As I've pointed out \nbefore, pyschological effects are no less real than other effects.  One       \nperson's \"make-believe\" can easily be another person's reality.  Using \npsychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example, the hallucinations one\nperson experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on\nan acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going\nto happen.  Anyhow, that was a pretty lame example, but hopefully I made my\npoint- it's all a matter of perception, and as long as someone ingesting MSG\nperceives it as causing bad effects, then s/he can definitely experience those\naffects.  On the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in,   or something.  Still, anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff that\nleads to the study being done.\n-Dan"

My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch\nto get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it\nstill hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  \nmuscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be\nbest not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although\nsome suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent \nirritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, \nwait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the\npuncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent\nirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to\ndo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the \nspot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,\nand spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \" apart.)\n\nThis is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few \nconcerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing \nher every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) \nand during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every \n4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. \nAs it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that \nthough I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she \nmentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 \nweeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had \nan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no \nproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain \nin my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very \ndifficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or \nmove unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for \nwhen I do need to go out.) \n\nAnyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from \nthe beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about \n2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  \n(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating \nvery much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well \nnow I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile \nrelated.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my \nupper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I \nwas lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because \nit started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  \nno matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I \nate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had \nturned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if \nI ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it \nwasn't as much of a problem.\n\nSo the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid \nfatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware \nof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have \nbeen avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat \nfoods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  \n\nBut doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat \nexcept fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, \nfried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I \nshould avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only \nhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( \npotatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in \na little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or \nsteamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have \nsome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if \nI'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it \nfrom my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if \nshe's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her \nrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on \ncholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She \noriginally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the \nentire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I \nstarted.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and \nshe's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also \nasked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them \nare.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, \nand feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did \nwant to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be \ntemporary for that one week. \n\nWhat I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I \nwould understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying \nthat anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she \nassumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that \nbecause of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to \nuse the energy from the food I do eat. \n\nAny opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm \ntruly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet \nbecause fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few \nminutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I \ndon't find any foods satisfying.\n\nThanks \n\nG"

Be sure that the foods are \ntested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.

        "subject": "How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation",
        "content": "I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\n\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \nper day).\n\n\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \n\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\n\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\n\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\n\n\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \n\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\n\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \n\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\n\n\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\n\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \n\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\n\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \nbefore supplementation.\n\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about \nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \nin urinary oxalate excretion.\n\n\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\n\n\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\n\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\n\n\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \n\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\n\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\n\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't \nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \n\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \nformation should be given B6 supplements.\n\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \ncalcium-oxalate.\n\n\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest.

But not all of them\ndid, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic\nFatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal\nMedicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue\nand Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that\nsome sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.\n\nAstonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively\nswollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's\nnothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the\nsyndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The\ndisagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers\non just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:\npsychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --\nmaybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental\ntoxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of\nthese.\n\nThere's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try\ndifferent things, some of which seem to help.\n\nMassive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.\nPost your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.\n\nNote: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)\ndiseases that look like CFIDS.

Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no \n\t   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.\n\n\t2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid \n\t   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.\n\n\t3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has \n\t   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by \n\t   the NCI.\n\nThese are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should \nnot committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of \nwhich result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal \nagents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be \nhaving a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of \ncommission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to \nrelieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,\nothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a \nchance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the \nhealer's oath, \"I will do no harm\".  But you know David that very few \ntreatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a \nvery difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each \nphysician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some \nare very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive \napproach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long \nas the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake \nin lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in \nthe medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as \nquacks or even unethical.\n\nWhat do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  \nThese people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the \nfrustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are \nreally doing a pretty good job of providing \"alternative\" medicine.  But \nmany lack any formal training and are in the \"business\" simply to make a \nfew fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting \ncompetent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative \ncare area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find \nsomeone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of \nmoney and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-\nmedical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the \nliscened physicians).\n\nI hope that this clears things up David.\n\nMarty B."

As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.\nThey showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\n\nI've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\n\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\n   water.\n\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\n\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\n\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\nstory here.\n\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\n\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe\nthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that\nthe victim's urine is strangely dense.

If it\nchanges anything. \n\nYou can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you\nhad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave\ncooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's\nhard to digest anyway. \n\nFor comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal \"last\" longer eat pasta or\nrice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe\nsmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the\nbaby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How\ntight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses \nyour middle. Be sure not to \"suck in\" your stomach when sitting, again it\nwill put pressure on the digestive tract. \n\nTry laying on your sides, back,\nand stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.\nEasier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby\n\"turn\" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.\nWhen you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the\ndiaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my\nsecond one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he\ndidn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.\n\n\nMaybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe\nshe just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. \nBut this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something\nto be avoided if possible. \n\nNausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My\nfirst pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble.\nSome articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better\nchance of carrying their baby. (grain of salt here) \n\nGood luck\n\n-Jackie-"

There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who\ntreat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly. \nThere are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones. \n\nThere are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories\nand rationals.

Plenty of illnesses\naren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue\nagainst the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month\nor so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an\nopinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. \n\nSometimes a correct diagnosis\ntakes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the\ndisease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have\nsomething that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been\ndescribed yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out,\nsometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment,\nsometimes they find it's incurable.  \n\nThere is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an \nillness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is\nmore like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking. \n\n-Jackie-"

Noring has pointed out\nthe catch-22 that if the \"crazy\" theory were true, you probably couldn't\nfind any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie\nbeasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the\nfellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set\nof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---\nnamely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,\nmany of them appear to get better.  \n\nSo, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,\ncontrolled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any\nbetter than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we\nhave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject\ndisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling\nback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any\nconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  \n\nAnd I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of\npeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything\nin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do\ncontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently\nsincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working\non themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also\nquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's\ncompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine\nscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting\noxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that\ndoesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some\nother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be\ntrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people\nhave been talking about.\n\nBut again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal\nevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some\ncandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,\nit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can\nmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough\nmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind\nstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out\nthe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can\nadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study\nshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.\n\nKen\n--"

Half of\nthe dead were women and children.\n    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the\nchildren were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the\nblood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.\n    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not\npiece them together. One woman holding her two children in her\nhands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no\nheads.''\n    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were\ndeplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had\nthe hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.\n    The six general practitioners who had been operating before\nhe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They\ndidn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''\n    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by\nmid-September he had run out of supplies.\n    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes\nthey were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no\nanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain\nbecause it increased bleeding.\n    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and\nstomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were\nimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.\n    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.\n    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived\nfrom the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.\n    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in\nmid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the\nregion. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''\n    Then the hunger set in.\n    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began\nair dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day\nfrom complications associated with malnutrition, he said.\n    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the\npeople from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.\n    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in\nSrebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.\n    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after\nvisiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.\n    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of\npeople standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when\nI left. And I cried too.''\n\n-- \nSharon Machlis Gartenberg\nFramingham, MA  USA\ne-mail: sharon@world.std.com"

And EVERY\ntime I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products.\nAnd consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge)\n- it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own\npersonal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST\nIMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof\nthat my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw\nout or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg -\nand he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple\nexplanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so\nI can either throw it out or give it away.)\n\n> From: pattee@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (Donna Pattee)\n\n> My guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained MSG, \n\nProbably Lawry's seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.  \n\nI'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  I've noticed that I\nhave a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once\na month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will\nbother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of\nthe Chinese restaurants the day before.  \n\n> From: kelley@healthy.uwaterloo.ca (Catherine L.

How many\npeople would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I\nKNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test.\nLike thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that\nmost people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at\ndifferent times.  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the\nreaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but\nfor some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ\nchips ;}).\n\n> From: kiran@village.com (Kiran Wagle)\n\n> Because too many of you (generic rhetorical 'you,' not 'you Cathy') go\n> around calling this \"Chinese restaurant syndrome,\" thus suggesting to the\n> people you complain to that you experience this ONLY from Chinese food. \n> MSG is prevalent in a LOT more things than Chinese food--thats why I\n> suggested calling this \"Diner syndrome.\"  \n\nCathy doesn't - I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it\n\"chinese restaurant syndrome\" and I NEVER stated I got it only from\nChinese food.

        "content": "The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary\non some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries.\nI hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n[Reprinted w/o permission]\n\n\n\"There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries\"\n\nBy Mike Royko\nTribune Media Services\n\n\n     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings \nis right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \nFamilies USA.\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \nthat doctors make too much money.\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \nOK.\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \nand are still simmering.\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \nof Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \ndo are stealing it from them.\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  \nKarl Marx lives.\n     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such \nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \nbecome a physician?\n     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should \nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \na doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a \ndoctor?\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  \"How \nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \nmore until they retire or fall over?\"\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \ncalled together to remake America's health care.\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \nto health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \nmajor cause of high medical costs.\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \na McDonald's?\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \ncabbages.\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \nthey might have been more honest if they had said:\n     \"Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \nproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, \nyou,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you \nguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; \ngetting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the \nmicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into \nthe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot \nvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease \nwhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.\n     \"You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single \nbiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is \namazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.\n     \"In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at \nyour blubbery bods all day.\n     \"So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and \nstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-\ngreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.\"\n     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, \nthere is another solution: Don't use them.\n     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those \nspine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands \nupon your head and declare you fit.\n     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest \npains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit \nthere, and pop in a couple of valves.\n     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that \noverpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house \nthan  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and \nmalpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?\n     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  \nAnd if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on \nhow to give it its shots.\n     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much \npollsters should earn?\n\n\nRoyko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  Media \nServices.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n--\n**********************************************\nVinay J.

The drastic change of environment\nwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even\nyoung people find the change unsettling.\n\nThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -\nanaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the\nelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the\nchange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have\ntried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the\npatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of\nthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these\npatients early.\n\nAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)\ngenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to\nthe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full\nmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is\nthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult\ntasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.\n\nHaloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life\nof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow\nrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are\nsensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing\nmore it is hard to comment.\n\nDon Mackie - his opinions\nesiology will disavow..."

If her current physician\nis unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone \nbook for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology, \nor contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society.\nBy finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tune\nwith the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help."

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among \n21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This \nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital \nDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. \n     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been \ncollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center \nfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were \nabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 \nparticipating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \ncesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national \nestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged \nafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from \nnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of \ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \nsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at \nthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value \nof 1.96. \n     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as \nin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean \nrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \nprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. \nIn 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) \nhigher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast \n(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \nthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \ngovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \nhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other \nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \npayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. \n     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women \nincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \nthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, \nessentially the same as the 23.5 observed. \n     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nestimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated \n338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary \ncesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been \nperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean \ndelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, \n35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., \nfailure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal \ndistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. \n     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In \ncomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, \nand for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC \ndeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 \ndays). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for \nprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and \nnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. \n\nReported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center \nfor Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from \n1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates \nhave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that \nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \nchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the \noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). \n     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections \n-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \nthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for \ncesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in \n1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and \n$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \n$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean \nrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number \nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), \nresulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital \ncharges. \n     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may \nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \ndelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women \noffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). \nOf women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) \n--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely \noffered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nnational data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) \nwas 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all \nwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was \nattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the \nVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \nrate. \n     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \ndelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review \nprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of \nphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \nawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, \nwhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean \ndelivery (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of \nState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases \namong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the \nhealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 \ncases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June \n1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and \nCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and \nidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This \nreport summarizes the results of the investigation. \n     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were \navailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if \nthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-\nconfirmed as having malaria. \n     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to \nobtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria \nchemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets \nand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long \nsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, \n128 (82%) responded. \n     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in \nKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less \nthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 \nyears (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk \nRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the \ncases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, \ncompared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the \nKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for \nmalaria. \n     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who \nparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine \nalone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were \nnot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly \nlower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 \n9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 \n24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported \nside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. \n     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nall or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely \nused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was \nalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening \n(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; \nupper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with \nfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the \nevening. \n     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel \nthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection \nmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to \nprovide window and door screens for all personnel. \n\nReported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical \nSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, \nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was \nattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased \nmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and \ncontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in \nmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for \nshort-term travelers to such areas. \n     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most \nother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas \n(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In \nAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in \npreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and \nwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk \nfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis \n(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 \nusers 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, \ngastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for \nother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). \n     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need \nfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen \n(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense \nchloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for \npersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil \nis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be \nused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. \nfalciparum has not been reported. \n     Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\non the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are \navailable from Health Information for International Travel, 1992 (i.e., \n\"yellow book\") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and \npertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the \nUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than \n90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these \norganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely \nrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined \nvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate \ninjections. \n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products \nfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for \nvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine \n(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in \nvaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. \n\n                               ActHIB Trademark \n\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), \nmanufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB \nTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This \nvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary \nvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously \nunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months \napart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one \ndose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all \nchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive \na single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving \na primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, \nand 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b \npolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to \nthat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in \nprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early \nbecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nfor use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease \nwere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and \nother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to \nthat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark \n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl \nRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL \nRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis \nBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). \n     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years \nfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when \nindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody \nresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark \nis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, \nand pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other \nDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. \n     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that \nall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-\n15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose \nprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, \n4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A \ncomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and \nTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed. \n\nReported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics \nEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

An international steering committee and scientific \nprogram committee provided guidance. \n     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including \nAsia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United \nStates and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National \nInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, \nand the Procter and Gamble Company. \n     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, \nprofessional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision \nof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and \nmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and \nwomen's issues. \n\n                                Recommendations\n\n     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association \nbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to \nestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for \nmore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology \nstudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral \nlesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. \n\n                                 Epidemiology\n\n     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV \nInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nradically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely \nin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  \nToday, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in \nchildren and adolescents. \n     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a \nmajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  \nFive hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more \nare appearing all the time. \n     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions \nsuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore \nthe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression \nand prognosis. \n\n                            Social/political Issues\n\n     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection \nfocused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for \nindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health \ncare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public \nabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. \n\n                          Saliva and Salivary Glands\n\n     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory \nactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary \nsecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular \nsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid \nsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible \nfor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect \nof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both \npromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) \ndirect effects on the virus or target cells. \n     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease \nin HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. \n\n                               Pediatric Issues\n\n     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With \nearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-\ninfected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from \nmother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's \nsero-status is known prior to giving birth. \n\n                    Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 12\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and \ngingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection.

It is more than 99 percent \neffective.\n\n\"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent \npregnancy,\" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. \"As an injectable, \ngiven once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to \nmissing a daily dose.\"\n\nDepo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and \nclinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive \nprotection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the \ninjections.\n\nAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and \nrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional \nbefore making a decision to use it.\n\nDepo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive \nstudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies \nin other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo \nProvera effective as an injectable contraceptive.\n\nThe most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In \naddition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, \ndizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have \nacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood \nclots in the legs, lungs or eyes.\n\nThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the \ndrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nRecent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to \nosteoporosis. The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this \npotential effect.\n\nDepo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for \ncontraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., \nwhich will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive \nInjection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. \nAt that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause \nbreast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer, \nincluding breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n       New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses\n                      P92-37 Food and Drug Administration\n                        Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new \nrules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life-\nthreatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. \n\n\"These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious \nillnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would \notherwise be possible,\" said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. \"The effort \nto accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and \nindeed a hallmark of this administration.\" \n\nThese rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to \napprove a drug based on \"surrogate endpoints\" or markers. They apply when the \ndrug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such \nendpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in \nthemselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified \nscientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. \n\nUse of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval \nearlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or \nprevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. \n\nThe new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and \neffectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. \nThe drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct \npostmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate \nendpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. \n\nOne new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a \nmodel of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the \ncause of AIDS. \n\nAccelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that \na drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used \nsafely only under a restricted distribution plan. \n\n\"The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process \nwithout sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight,\" said FDA \ncommissioner David A.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \nvisual impairment \n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \nYancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of \nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \nand for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nresult frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF \ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \nsurgically.\" \n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By \nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). \n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and \nSteinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 19\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease\n\n                          Research Resources Reporter\n                           written by Mary Weideman\n                                 Nov/Dec 1992\n                         National Institutes of Health\n\n\n     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary \nheart disease in native populations of developing countries that have \ntraditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to \ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \ncountries. \n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \nlow in cholesterol and fat.\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\ncholesterol. \n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \ninvestigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol \nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's \"affluent\" diet used in the study \nranks a CSI of 149. \n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects' mean plasma \ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \ndays. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \nof their usual high fat intake. \n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \ndisease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different \ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                             General Announcments\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \ncalling the NCI's Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus \nexpression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this  \nrecombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus \ndoes in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in \npatients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune \nresponses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and \nCD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never \nintended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.

In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-\nantibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific \nactivation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  \nmay contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 \nbinding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added \nsafety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, \nstimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune \nfunction.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was \nchosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first \nphase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith. \n==================================================================    \n\"HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. \n341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline) \n\n     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive \nwomen breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The \nanti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of \nleukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic  \nactivity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to \nbarely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to \ntwelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.  \nBreastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory \nillnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive \nmothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-\n1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than \nbottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower \nprogression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer \nprotection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of \nmilk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA \nantibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against \ncore antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a \nhuman  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and \nmalnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is \nstill the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.  \nTransmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early \nmilk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast \nmilk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  \nmay even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok. \n==================================================================    \n\"Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients\" Journal \nof the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269,  No. 14, P. 1802  \n(Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.) \n\n     If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV  transmission \nfrom dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M.

The \nresearchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and \nattempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients \nwith newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysis \nwas performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the \ndentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the \nmedical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug \nabuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  \nThere were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  \nwere deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients \nidentified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were either \nhomosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the \nremaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was \nreported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence \nof risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single  \nevaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence \nanalysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients \nwere not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV \ntransmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting \nin which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  et \nal. \n       ================================================================   \n                                April 22, 1993 \n       ================================================================   \n\"AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says\" Washington \nPost (04/22/93), P. A13 \n\n     Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes the \nresurging health hazard harder to control, according to a  study published in \ntoday's New England Journal of Medicine.   People who contract TB usually \ndevelop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria \nagain.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight \noff a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes \nMedical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that in \norder to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to \nuse TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB \nbacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County \nHospital  in New York. \n================================================================    \n\"HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. \n341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline) \n\n     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive \nwomen breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's  \nhypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to \nAIDS, \"a hindrance to public health initiatives.\"   However, their hypothesis \nthat HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  \nThe U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, \nno prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this \nhypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  \ndepletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies \nagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals \nfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug-\nAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-\nfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  \nuse altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to \nproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years \nHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same \nAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nproponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS.  \nAlternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs \nfor 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg. \n================================================================   \n\"Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection\" \nLancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.) \n\n     Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases \nin some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infected \nindividuals through the amplification of harmful  \"autoimmune\" reactions, \nwrite Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  \nThe researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with \nhepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  \nprofound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the \nobservation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had \ncirculating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the \nend of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, \ncontained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  \naminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, \nhomologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  \nThese autoantibodies, which also  recognize \"native\" class II molecules and \nmay contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells \"in vivo\", were at low tires \n(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  \nautoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and \nHCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss \nin some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful \n\"autoimmune\" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA \nantigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell \ncounts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very  \nrapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with \nthese HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude. \n       ================================================================   \n                                April 23, 1993 \n       ================================================================    \n\"TB Makes a Comeback\" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6   \n(Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) \n\n     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United \nStates, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, \nminorities, and prisoners.

State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because \nthose who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with \ntreatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public \nhealth services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic \"because the number of \ncases  is increasing faster than we can treat people,\" said Dr. George  \nDiferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to \nDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of \ndiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City \nresidents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their  \nmedication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more \nexpensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to \ntreat.\n ================================================================    \n \"Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern \nFlorida: Artifact or Reality?\" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. \n83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) \n\n     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in \nsouthern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write \nOkey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  \nThe researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal \nPalm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual \ntransmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, \nor  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route \nof HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records \nfrom social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually \ntransmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor \nwas found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  \nstandardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were \nreviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission \ncategories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the \npercentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties \nbetween January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to \nheterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men \nand from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  \nheterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after \nadjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the \nnational average, the researchers  conclude.\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                                AIDS Statistics\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                            World Health Organization, Geneva\n                        Organisation mondiale de la Sante, Geneve\n\n                              WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD\n                           RELEVE EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE HEBDOMADAIRE\n\n15 January 1993 -

Fordham) \n\n     The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is \nextremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal \ninfection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\ \n       =================================================================     \n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \n\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \n      ==================================================================\n                                April 20, 1993 \n      ==================================================================\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \n(Kolata, Gina) \n\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We're delighted to see the  \npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \nMaddox. \n      ================================================================== \n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \net al.) \n\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \nconclude. \n      ==================================================================    \n                                April 21, 1993 \n      ==================================================================    \n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \n(04/21/93), P. 7A \n\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \ninfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily \nfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies \nsince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual \nAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, \nled the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come \ntogether, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies \ninvolved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are  \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche, \nEli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck, \nSyntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The \nparticipants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they \nwere aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively  \ninvolved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the \ncollaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong \nscientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nand early clinical data.  The  American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) \nwas pleased with  the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead to \nthe  development of drug combinations that will reduce viral  resistance.   \nRelated Story: Financial Times (04/21) P. 1 \n==================================================================    \n\"Guidance Over HIV-Infected Health-Care Workers\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, \nNo. 8850, P. 952  (Horton, Richard) \n\n     The United Kingdom's Department of Health recently followed the  advice \nof AIDS experts that there is no scientific reason for  routine HIV testing \namong health-care workers.  Following recent  highly publicized reports of \nhealth professionals who contracted  HIV, the department issued revised \nguidelines on the management  of such cases.  Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief \nMedical Officer, said  doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care \nworkers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV  \ninfection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic HIV testing.

You should\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \n complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)\n you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\n\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\n  \n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\n\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\n \n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\n are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine \n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\n The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'\n  \n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\n \n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \n\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\n \n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\n\n   -- Ron Roth --\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n *   \"Eating Radium has strange results,\"  Tom said brightly.\n---\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363"

All the clamor \nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known \nfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a \nwomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and \nnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\n\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \nwarrented.\n\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \nrestricting calcium intake.\n\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans \nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \ninfections should decline.\n\nMarty B."

I would appreciate any comments about this and other\n'new' technology for hearing aids.\n\nThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and\nappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that\na new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and\nprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of\nthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help\nout in 'noisy' situations.\n\nThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the\nspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),\napparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in\nthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information\n(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are\ntreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have\nalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call\n'abnormal growth of loudness'.\n\nThis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I\nthink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you\nexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit\nbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach\nthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means\nthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high\nend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively\nless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.\nYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially\ndifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially\nfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls\noff a cliff).\n\nAids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low\nand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency\ninformation because of high volume of low frequency components.\nParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech\nand in simulated restaurant noise situations. \n\n-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,\nUSA"

Whether or not it is a \"logical\nextension\" from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who\nbase strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of\nclinical trials. \n  One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly\nrecalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection).

PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most \nphysicians don't recognize it as a specific \"disease\" entity.  Here is \neverything that you would ever want to know about PMS.\n\nPremenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:\n\n\tPMT-A(Anxiety)\t\tPMT-D(depression)\n\tanxiety\t\t\tdepression\n\tirritability\t\tforgetfulness\n\tinsomnia\t\tconfusion\n\tdepression\t\tlethargy\n\n\tPMT-C(Craving)\t\tPMT-H(Hyperhydration)\n\tcraving for sweets\tweight gain\n\tincreased appetite\tbreast congestion and tenderness\n\tsugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness\n\t 1. headache\t\tedema of the face and extremities\n\t 2. palpitations\n\t 3. fatigue or fainting\n \nPMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low \nprogesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle.\n\nPMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple \ncarbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is \nincreased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose \nchallenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are \na low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia \nis not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of \nhypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.\n\tA. Am. J.

Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead \ntoxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \nphase). \"Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human \nendometrial cystol\" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).\n\nPMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated \nserum aldosterone level.

Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.\n\n\tB. \"Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension \n\t    syndromes\", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).\n\n\tC. \"Premenstrual tension\", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)\n\nTreatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can \nfind a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one \nthat will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, \nsupplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really \nhas been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida \nblooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental \ncontrolled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to \nsee done).\n\nHere are a few of these studies:\n\n\tCARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, \"Effect of a low-fat, \n\thigh-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy\" Lancet \n\t2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy \n\tof at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive \n\tspecific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories \n\tand increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary \n\tadvise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant \n\treduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in \n\tthe trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as \n\tphysical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, \n\ttenderness and nodularity.\n\n\tVITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, \"The use of Vitamin A in \n\tpremenstrual tension\" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  \n\t218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU \n\tvitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored \n\tand high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of \n\ttoxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the \n\tstudy was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool \n\tsize(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this \n\tnormal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose \n\tvitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% \n\tgetting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.\n  \t10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS \n\tsymptoms.\n\n\tExperimental Controlled Study, \"Premenstrual tension treated with \n\tvitamin A\" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts \n\treceived 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their \n\tcycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.\n  \tAfter 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in \n\tPMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of \n\ttoxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year \n\tafter high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms \n\tdid not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the \n\tvitamin A supplementation was stopped.\n\nMost Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  \nThese studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal \nstore of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins \ngiven for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best \nsingle effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid \n(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full \nof vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent \nthe symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying \nto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin \nA toxicity.\n\n\tVITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, \"Pyridoxine\n\t(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover \n\ttrial\"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 \n\twith moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.\n  \tAfter 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another \n\t3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of \n\tPMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS \n\twere not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The efects of vitamin B6 \n\tsupplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms\" Obstet. Gynecol \n\t70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received \n\t150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence \n\tshowed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related \n\tto the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as \n\tbehavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)\n  \tAnxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 \n\tsupplementation.\n\nVitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control \npills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  \nWomen on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per \nday.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. \nRubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in \nClin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be \nconsidered the \"first-line\" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the \npatient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin \nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each \nday. \n\n\n\tVITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Efficacy of alpha-\n\ttocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome\" J. Reprod. \n\tMed. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 \n\tcycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a \n\tsignificant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast \n\ttenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant\n \treduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% \n\thad a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo \n\tgroup.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant\n\tdecrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The effect of alpha-tocopherol on \n\tpremenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study\" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. \n\t2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly \n\treceived vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After \n\t2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly \n\timproved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly \n\timprove PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H\n\t(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve \n\tPMT-H symptoms).\n\t\n\tMAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Magnesium prophylaxis \n\tof menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium\" Headache \n\t31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg \n\tdaily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a \n\tplacebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and \n\tcontinued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index \n\twas significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment \n\twas also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual \n\tDistress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  \n\tlymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower \n\tin this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer \n\tfrom PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised \n\tinto the normal range.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Oral Magnesium successfully \n\trelieves premenstrual mood changes\" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). \n\t32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid \n\t360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the \n\tonset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received \n\tmagnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster \n\tpain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the \n\tmagnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were \n\tswitched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on \n\tthe Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by \n\tmagnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium \n\tsupplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes \n\tthat occur during PMS.\n\nThere are numerous observational studies that have been published in the \nmedical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder \nthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But \nsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. \nto be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are \nalso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on \nmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the \nbest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out \nthat PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize \nnutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, \npellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor \nbeing trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS \nis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional \ndisorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.\n\nHere's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral \nsupplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.\n\n\tExperimental Study, \"Effect of a nutritional programme on \n\tpremenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis\", Complement. Med. \n\tRes.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and \n\tsupplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, \n\tmagnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to \n\ttake the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate \n\tdiet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an \n\timprovement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that \n\tthey no longer suffered from PMS. \n\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Role of Nutrition in managing \n\tpremenstrual tension syndromes\", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  \n\tA low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite \n\tsupplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet \n\tchange and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the \n\tvitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased \n\testradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel \n\tphase of their cycle.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Clinical and biochemical effects \n\tof nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome\", J. \n\tReprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 \n\ttablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a \n\tsignificant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another\n \tgroup of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this \n\tsecond group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on \n\tPMS symptoms was observed.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 W. 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok 74107\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\""

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung \ndisease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side\n-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also \nbinds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when \nEDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that \nwere not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove \ncalcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C \nand magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra \nvitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium \nfrom the plaques).\n\nThe calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably \ncan be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.

L. \nacidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily \nresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of \nthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. \nbulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are \nmuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told \nme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several \ndifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't \ntold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative \nanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a \nchance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria \naround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal \nregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida \nblooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from \nthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do \nbelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower \ncolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the \ncompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.\nRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get \nrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A \nsupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the \ngood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the \npH to basically starve the candida out.\n\n\nMarty B."

Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the \nfrequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the \ncandida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus \nshould be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the \nintestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to \noxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the \nlay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really \namazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.\n\n\nThe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all \nconventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if \nconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard \nmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?\nThe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very \nimportant one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria \nafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason \nto dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply \nand safely(like it is in animal husbandry).\n\nMarty B."

        "content": "Here is a press release from the American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees.\n\n Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other Unions\nCommemorate Workers Memorial Day\n To: National Desk, Labor Writer\n Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State, County\nand Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions\nof the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifth\nannual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6\nmillion workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job.\n   This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an\nthe dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work.\nEarlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, Robert\nVallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections\nfacility in Lucasville, Ohio.\n   The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady\nincrease in the prison population for the past five years.  On\nJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections\nshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an\nexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.\n   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has\ncreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in the\nnumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against\nstaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain\nhigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,\ncompared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.\n   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous\ncombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio\nofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in\nthe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and\nsafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis\nB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.\n   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's\nfederal, state and local correctional facilities.\n   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under\nlife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers\ndie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from\noccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation's\nmost dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:\n\n   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and\n      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are\n      not barricaded or don't have proper lighting.\n   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of\n      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector\n      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more\n      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private\n      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the\n      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care\n      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes\n      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses\n      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety\n      issues facing health care workers include exposure to\n      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high\n      levels of stress.\n   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health\n      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,\n      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man\n      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler\n      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.\n      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the\n      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a\n      growing lack of support services for people who don't have\n      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some\n      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.\n      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.\n      The \"quality\" of the clients is also becoming more violent,\n      as more are moved out of the institutions.\n\n   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards\nsince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.\nMcEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety\nprotections for public employees.\n   \"More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the\njob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA\ncoverage for public employees,\" said McEntee.  \"This, despite the\nfact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,\ncorrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most\ndangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for\npassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater\nrights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees\nsafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.\"\n   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private\nsector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more\nsevere.\n   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed\nin 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states\nhave no OSHA coverage.\n -30-\n--\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\n416-629-7000/629-7044"

Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\notherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional\n\"difficult\" patient.\n\nPoint 2:\n\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\na treatment point-of-view.\n\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\n\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\nfrom them.\n\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\n\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.\nJust my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^)\n\nComments?\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

She said even common ear infections frequently seen in\nchildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.\n\n\"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases\nwould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases\nremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness\nand death in the United States,\" the CDC said.\n\nIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a \"myriad\" of newly\nidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a\ndeadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that\ncauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.\n\n\"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,\nsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,\"\nthe CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been\nundermined by drug resistance.\n\n=====*=====\n\nSOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL\nREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1\nHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues\n\nThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause\ndamage: legal liability.\n\nA federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not\ndoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much\nattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like\nillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in\nrare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners\non notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from\nthe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if\nsomeone becomes infected while on the property.\n\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came\nafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the\nLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the\ndisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered\nthe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than\n$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical\nexpenses and lost wages.\n\nSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or\nsemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the\ngroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.\nKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a\nlegal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential\nliability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard\nbarbecue might be potentially liable.\n\nLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer\nvacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home\nshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky\nMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered\nan outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was\nstung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent\nquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence\nthat a beehive was near the restaurant.\n\nBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the\ncountry -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic\nstates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this\nparticular insect bite a particularly litigious one.\n\nThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the\ncourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will\ncover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not\ndiagnosing the disease.\n\nLawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease\nhave become common in some states in recent years. Payments in\nworker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and\nlost earnings.\n\nThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more\nlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of\nnegligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing\ninjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a\nresult, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property\nowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many\nother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the\ndisease.\n\nIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &\nMaurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help\nto establish \"the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect\nagainst Lyme disease.\"\n\nLawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a\nlawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For\none thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when\nand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs\nin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned\nby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.\nThe workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to\nthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded\nsome work sites.\n\nA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that\nthe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is\nconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding\nthat it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says\nthe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special\npants to protect against bug bites.\n\nDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up\nsome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a\nvictim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.\nEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association\nreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.\nAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical\ndisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.\n\nBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies\nalready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last\nyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &\nCo. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston\nthat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-\nsupply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company\nwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might\nget infected.\n\nRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in\nIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her\norganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole\nKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners\nAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their\n100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing\npesticide.\n\n=====*=====\n\nTITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.\nAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,\nDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson\nUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30\n\nLyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is\nassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients\nwith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.\nUrodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and\ndetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not\nnoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract\nmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding\ndysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may\ndirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the\nLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological\nsymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was\nprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological\ndeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme\ndisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential\ndiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder\nmanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic\nevaluation is recommended.\n\n\nIV. ***** QUESTIONS 'N' ANSWERS *****\n\nNote: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to the\neditor.\n\nSender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.edu>\nSubject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles\n\n  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the\ncompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became\ninfected.\n\n  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to\nback that claim up with documentation.

Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries\nhave more power than you might realize, and you never know-\ncould be the dean of admissions answering the phone.\n\n> Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i\n\nIf you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate\nyourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing\nyou into medicine; your academic and extracurricular\naccomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really*\nwant to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out\nin the first semester of med school because they found it was\nnot what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four\nyears in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a\ncareer is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be\npushed into it because of your parents/family/significant\nother.  \n\nIf you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you\ncan improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from\na professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive\nrecommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous\nprofessor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't\nbe afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest\nand positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,\nsorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I\nhave turned down writing recommendations for some students\nbecause I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful\ncomments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them\nat that point.  \n\nRewrite your personal statement; take it by an English\nprofessor or some other friendly person with skill and\nexperience in writing and proof-reading and get their\ncriticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you\nsay it.\n\nReview your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor\nin some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further\ncoursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help\nhere.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut\ncourses, it usually shows.\n\nLook at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in\nlocal philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;\nsubstantial leadership roles in an organization help also.\nBeware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to\nspot and weed out.\n\nOverall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why\nyou want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal\nof skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in\napplying to any program, medical or what-have-you.\n\nGood luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting\nis the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)\n\nBob Schmieg"

Later,  when she (a young\nwoman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did\nthe honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they lived\nhappily ever after.  \nPerhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would come\ninto class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from about\n3/8\" to 1/2\" over a 10 inch length).

It is a protozoan that \nlives and multiplies within cells.  In cats, the protozoan multiplies in the\nintestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa can\ncross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic\nafter the baby is born, or it may be very severe.

Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or\nwhatever, or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like an\nantihistamine does?)  As far as doctors over here are concerned, if you slip up\nand eat something you're allergic to (even if they won't test you to tell you\nwhat to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms,\nthen fine, otherwise you just suffer.  One doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs\nthe NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwing\nup for four solid days and couldn't even drink water - but I got taken off it\nagain when I moved and had to change doctors.  Reasoning: they did not know what\nthe side-effects were because it was new.  OK, fine - but it has passed the\nsafety tests to get on the prescription list, and anyway I was prepared to take\nthe risk to have quality of life now.  The only alternatives I have is to get it\nprescribed privately, which I cannot afford, or to pay a private allergy\nspecialist to test me and tell me what to avoid.  I am fairly certain I am\nallergic to more than one chemical additive, as a lot of things I can't eat have\nnothing in common except things I know are safe, so testing myself isn't really\nan option; there are too many permutations.\n\n> I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.

Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, \nbut they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, some\nschools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look\nat your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund\non your $50 application fee.\n\nBut, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers\nand are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was it\nan acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was a\ndenial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How\ndid your interviews go?\n\nAs for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted\nme for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was\nover and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection\nletters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are\nstill interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become\nfixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.\n\nWhat do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very\nmediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software\nengineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still,\nI think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted\nis something like this:\n\nVERY IMPORTANT\n--------------\nGPA:\t3.5 or better\nMCAT:   top 15% in all subject\n\nMEDIUM IMPORTANCE\n-----------------\nWriting/Speaking ability\nMaturity\nMotivation for going into medicine\nActivities\n\nLESS IMPORTANT\n--------------\nCollege or University\nMajor\nWork experience\nAnything else you want them to know\n\n\nAnyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in\nmany ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each\nperson as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline \nsearch and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since \ncommercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or \nbulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.\nThis is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are \nrecommended rather than yogurt.\n\nI guess the next question is why would this introduction of \"good\" bacteria \nback into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the \nanus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy\ndenys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a \nfacultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and \ncolonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain \nthe reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion \nwas stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the \nintestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida \nlooses it's major food source.\n\nGetting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is \nnormally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal \nyeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has \nbeen used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in \nthe medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting \ntheir own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their \npatients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if \never published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age \nemerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the \nmedical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to \nhelp patients or does it look the other way.\n\nThis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous \ntherapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).

There were \n\tactually some people who were more careful in their methodology\n\twho also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'\n\n    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography\n    is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the\n    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic\n    or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's\n    City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research \n    named A. J. Ellison.\n\n    After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison\n    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we\n    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of\n    the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than\n    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing\n    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited\n    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and\n    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be\n    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and\n    usually also tracer chemicals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tkind regards,\n\n\t\t\t\t\ttodd\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Todd I.

The levels might have stabilized\nover time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch\nto Mevicore.  \n\nOn Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108, \nand HDL was 35; but the trig's were still\nvery high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal, \nSGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35).\n\nHe said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him\nconcern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol\nfigures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal (\"Just\nto be extra cautious, though I'm sure it's not a problem.\"),\nand wants me to go back on it after that.

Is my liver in danger with the above\nresults?  Would I be better off on Lopid, despite its inconvenient \nside effect, or, perhaps, some other drug?  (Niacin affected my \nliver, too)."

As I understand it,\nthe hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally\nhave some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki\nring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,\nif I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,\nfood occasionally gets \"stuck\" before reaching my stomach. This results\nin a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.\nFortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,\nand causes frequent discomfort.\n\nMy doctor wants to \"dilate\" the ring using the\nfollowing procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach\nfor any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing\nsome kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know\nif anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,\nwas it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on\nsafety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become\na common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding\nprocedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,\nespecially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,\nreaction to anesthesia).\n\nThe second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number\nof \"extra\" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there\nhas been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24\nhrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this,\nhowever-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist\nindicated that such a number was \"normal\". It certainly doesn't\nfeel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of\nextended \"runs\" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause\nsevere light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good\nhealth (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or\ncaffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as \"normal\", but don't\nwant to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number\nof PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something\nas simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying\ndown for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly\nbe related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the\nsame time.\n\nThanks for any help/advice!\n\n\n===============================================================================\n==============================================================================="

        "content": "Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes.\n\n New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at\nHuntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported\n To: National Desk, Health Writer\n Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or\n          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research\n          Institutes.\n\n   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing \nand measuring chemical imbalances in the brain\nwhich lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been\ndiscovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research\nInstitutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research\nwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,\nRadiology.\n   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ncalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led\nby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly\npatients who were believed to be suffering from some form of\ndementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special\nsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical\nProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses\nin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton\nMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination\ntime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10\nminutes.  By comparison, the current \"standard of care\" in testing\nfor Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and\nneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the\npatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.\n   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\nexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including\nAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's\ndisease.\n   \"We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly\nand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted\nwith either the MRS or PROBE software,\" said Dr. Ross, adding,\n\"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and\nintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease\ncauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.\"\n   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the\nbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker\nin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed\nwith Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their\nlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was\nsignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons\nbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.\n   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely\nconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross\nbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an\ninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\nthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\nyears, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based\non the changing receptors for acetylcholine.\n   \"Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate\nAlzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or\nher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment\nprotocols for the treatment of this disease.

As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\nmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\nloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\n   How many people does it affect?\n   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\nthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\napproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's\ndebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\nemotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the\nmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\nyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\n   What are its signs and symptoms?\n   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\nbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\nof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\nyars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\nto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\nAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\ndeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe \"forgetfulness\"\ncaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School\nof Medicine at New York University says \"whether forgetfulness is\na serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree\" and\nsuggests the following criteria:\n\n   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is\n      normal.\n   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.\n   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.\n   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.\n\n   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be\nevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms\nof dementia.\n -30-\n--\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\n416-629-7000/629-7044"

I'm\n>trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated.\n>Thanks.\n\nYou've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which\nare used for chemotherapy.\n\nThe overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of\nthese crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy\ncancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different\neffects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than\none drug at a time.\n\nSome chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle\nof a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.\n\nThe first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis\nand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.\nThe third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized \naagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.\n\nThere are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.\nOthers stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.\nAt any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells\nto stop growing.\n\nIf what you are seeking is \"practical\" advice, I apologize for rambling\non the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs\nare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to \nexperience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small\nfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter\nknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines\ntthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications \ncan be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.\n\nProbably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always\nhappen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person \nthemself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different\nside effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug\nheadband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably\nby reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this\ntoo, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.\n\nI highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society.\nThey have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition,\nif your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend \"Reach for Recovery\".\nIt is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast \nbecause of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.\n\nIf you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some good\naccess to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.\n\nI wish the best to you and your friend."

First of all, I would want to know who\n sponsored that study.\n I have seen too many \"nutrition\" bulletins over the years from\n local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the\n bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us\n compliments of the Dairy Industries.\n There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive\n financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous \n benefits of increasing one's calcium intake.\n\n Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved \n in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study\n didn't say that, it only claimed that \"most kidney stones are large-\n ly calcium.\"\n Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact\n opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they\n are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.\n \n Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still \n the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention \n of kidney stones.\n I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in\n one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney\n stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE\n in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium\n type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit\n from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!\n\n     Ron Roth\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n * A stone on the ground is better than a stone in the body.\n---\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363"

There are non-surgical ways,\nhowever, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their\nostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.\nThe underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of\nsinus surgery, though.\n\nAbout asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,\n\"Sinus Survival\", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases\nof asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage\n(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found\nrelief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -\nnot clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.\n\nBefore doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,\nas well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus \nin the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors \nin the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may \nbe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care \nto comment?).\n\nMost stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, \nI don't think that there are many drugs that can help \"dissolve\" the \nkidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium \nhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the \naterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could \nspeed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that \na diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery \nis being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second \nopinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break \nup the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are \nnotorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  \nMy condolences to your friend. \n\nMarty B."

My personal experience, and I have the same \nhistory an build you do (related to the heart, that is), is that my PVC's\ncome and go, with some months causing anxiety.  Taking on more fluids\nseems to help, and they seem worse in the summer.  Remember that a slow \nheart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent, so perhaps it is an \nindication of a healthy cardiac system (but ask an expert about that\nlast point, especially)\n\nGood luck, hope we don't die of arrhythmias.

But colonic flushes are not the \nway to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of \nbacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of \nantibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in \nyour gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real \nproblem in some of the outfits that do this \"treatment\" since the equipment \nis not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient \"treatments\".\nDental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've \npicked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his \ninstruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is \nalso used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and \ndisposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than \nthe standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much \nhigher fees do not drive away patients.\n\nI can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to \nthis colonic flush procedure.  For very little, if any benefit, you \nsubject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIV.\nJust ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment?\nCould they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to a \npathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not \ncleaned properly between patients?  Do I really want to take this risk?\nFood for thought.\n\nMarty B."

Once you have read this post, you \nshould know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future.\n\nIn article <123552@netnews.upenn.edu>, lchaplyn@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Lida Chaplynsky) writes:\n> \n> A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on\n> by menopause as well as a mental break down.

Both my wife and I suffered from \nbouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a \nrebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and \nchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through \nher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When \nsevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to \nuse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had \"cured\" her PMS using \nsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet \nin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and \nshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after \nby wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and \none reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another \nstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with \nsupplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. \nI was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using \nB6, niacin, folate and B12 to \"cure\" depression.  I'm not going to do that \nbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.\n\nLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the \nproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use \nan approach which will \"fix\" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly \nwhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be \naffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these \nstressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was \npretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is \na nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your \nbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), \nyou have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any \nnutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from \nbeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase \nyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become \nvery important.\n\nLida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to \ntry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming \nfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic \nMedical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because \nnone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I \npreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by \nmy students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:\n\nIndroduction and Carbohydrates \t\t\tLipids\n\nProteins I\t\t\t\t\tProteins II\n\nEnergy Balance\t\t\t\t\tEvaluation of Nutritional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStatus I, A Clinical \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerspective\n\nEvaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional\t\t\nA Biochemical Perspective\t\t\tStatus III, Homework \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAssignment Using the \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNutritionist IV Diet and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness Analysis Software \n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogram\n\nWeight Control\t\t\t\t\tFood Fads and Facts\n\nAge-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements\tFood Additives, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tContaminants and Cancer\n\nDrug-Nutrient Interactions\t\t\tMineral and Water Balance\n\nSodium, Potassium and Chloride\t\t\tCalcium, Magnesium and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhosphorus\n\nIron\t\t\t\t\t\tZinc and Copper\n\nIodine and Fluoride\t\t\t\tOther Trace Minerals\n\nVitamin A\t\t\t\t\tVitamin E\n\nVitamins D and K\t\t\t\tVitamin C\n\nThiamin and Niacin\t\t\t\tRiboflavin and Pyridoxine\n\nPantothenic and Folic acids\t\t\tBiotin and B12\n\nOther Nutrient Factors\t\t\t\tEnteral Nutrition\n\nParenteral Nutrition\n\nEvery three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature \nto find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this \nin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down \nand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books \nthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which \nI write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various \ncopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for \neducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not \nsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).\n\nI am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition \nassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need \nto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the \nnutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to \nbe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to \ndesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment \nCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization with \nhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a \nnutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin \nClinic in California has a similiar lab setup.\n\nFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new \nClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I \nhave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown \nseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more \nto residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition\ntextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it \ndoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a \npatient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the \nPreface of this new text:\n\n\"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, \nhematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge \nof nutrition as it related to their field of practice.\"  \n\n\"Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United \nStates require no formal instruction in nutrition.\"\n\n\"But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the \nleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.\"\n\n\"... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it \nshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of \nnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your \nawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important \nfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially \nevery organ system.\"\n\nRoland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH \n\nLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find \na physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals\n(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and \nwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when \nwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are \noccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A \nnutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned \nthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red \ncell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium \nreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to \ntry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are \nalso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral \nanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using \ncertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some \npretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone \nwho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are \nusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Act).  \n\nA diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown \nto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging \nand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But \nthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not \nshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.\nUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the \nU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional \nprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses \ndiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue \nto be the best approach to depression.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance.\""

Too much can block the\nexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some \nhearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your\nown, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and\nfill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen\nperoxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)\nand insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  \nfirmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the\ntenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl \nunder the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy\na syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever\nyou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try\nadding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up\nthe wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also\nsafe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse\nit out.\nGood Luck\n-heather"

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not \nall calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium-\noxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article \nas a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that \nconventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably \nalways will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that \nyou will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of \ndamage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to \nsinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?).\n\nOn the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical \nchemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of \ncalcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to \nmeasure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the \nserum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good \nnutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue \nreserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see \nhow your technique compares with mine.\n\n\nMarty B."

But before I do, I want to \nget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney \nstone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart \ndisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to \nencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do \nmost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from \nthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to \nbe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.\nSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have \na problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you \nor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.\nHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help \nyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment \nprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When \nmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin \nE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, \nplan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet \nchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.\nBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation \nand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as \nyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a \nregular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her \ngynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even \nscheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for \nthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa).\n\nOne more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses \nhigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is \nabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have \ndrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is \nreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and \nminerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't \nbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a \nlot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new \nClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab \ntests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet \nchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you \nhandle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,\nI'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really \ndon't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think \nthat I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a \nfew with an axe to grind.  That's life.\n\nChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very \nimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor\n(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine \nand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to \nform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,\nand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is \nseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral \nchelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest \nfor all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has \ncome up there several times as a \"fat burner\".  Chromium is among the least \ntoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really \ndo any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for \nchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about \n30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many \nbelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I \ncan cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in \nType II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there \nalso seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is \nbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when \nchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to \nType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and \nglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is \nconcerned\n\nSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, \nthis possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little \nmore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin \nresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity \nis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular \npressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with \nglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. \nNutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt \npeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, \njust about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless \nthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often \nfound in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the \nRBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would \nprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to \ncheck out this possible chromium link to glucoma.\n\nYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC \nchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a \nRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail \nanalysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny \nbusiness going on in these unregulated labs right now.\n\nHere's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider \nchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is \navailable(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they \nalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not \nroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change \nand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?\nMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical \nresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium \nsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of \nCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.\n\nWhat's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight\n(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then \nexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most \nAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have \na poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  \nWhen he or she says, \"what in the world are you talking about\", just say, \nplease get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook \nand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose \ntolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you \nvery much.\n\nMarty B."

While I was a student, I had doctors remove\nrather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple\ntimes, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, and\nsaid something like \"Gee, you've got a lot of wax in there\".  In my case,\nremoval of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, and\nI've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with\nwarm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy little\nbulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store -\nI don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.\n\nOne question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated\na drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining\ntrapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming, too.  It\nworks, but it stings like the devil, so I've always been content to let any\nwater in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get\nout by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.

So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing \nby this \"hated\" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?\nElisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.\nA book that you should be familiar with and not \"hate\". \"Candida species \ncolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly \nthereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \nit.\n\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: \"However, some factors, such as \nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \n\n\n>>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \n>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.

(shudder)\n> Or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifying?\n\nMy, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you \nnoticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist.\nCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point \nout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, \npseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist \nand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of \nGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.\n\nYou know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small \nlittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in \nSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.\nI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what \nI've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into \n\"The Yeast Connection\" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain \nand simple.

My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the\npossibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in\n1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book\nbecause 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written\nfrom a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept\nan open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the \"yeast\nconnection\".\n\nBut, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right\nclinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In\nthe meantime, I'd still encourage people who have \"incurable\" chronic sinus\nproblems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to\nadminister a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with\nliver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It\nis an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT\nsays \"sorry, you'll just have to live with it\", it is time to step out and\ntry an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence\n(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At\nthis stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and\nhave the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive\nclinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with\nrelatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since I\nsaw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of\ncourse, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not\nwork for you.

I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an\noncologist.\n\nA bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a\ndose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the\ndistribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given\nintravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will\ninsert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. \n\nAfter a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the\nbody, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high \nconcentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for\nareas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.\n\nAs far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required\nto start the IV line.\n\nWhat the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may\nhave resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother\nhas had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the\nskeletal system.\n\nI hope I have answered some of your questions.  Feel free to e-mail me if\nyou have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related\nto your mother's care.  I'm a newly graduated nurse, and I enjoy sharing\ninformation with other people to help them understand things that they did\nnot know about before.\n\nMy thoughts are with you both.\n\nElisa B.

        "content": "For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful\nwhen I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also\npretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of\nbedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I\nwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because\nI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I\nwent to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.\n\n\tAnyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to\nget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;\nbut he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So\nI used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly\nand felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually\nfelt refreshed the next morning.\n\n\tSo,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and\nexperimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am\npresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The\nantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought\nsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't\nnotice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about\n1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research\nseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest\nsedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic\nform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good\ndosage level to try.\n\n\tFor other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have\nan allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry\neyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did\nguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some\nchanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I\nwent back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)\n\n\tAnyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of\nantihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use\n(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by\nmillions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be\na serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,\nwhereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have\ntried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to\nlower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some\nkind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in\nany other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried\nmany of the non-pharmacological solutions)"

        "content": "Robert,\n\nI'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I've \nbeen compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.\nI didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just \nlike I haven't read \"The Yeast Connection\").\n\nLet me just start by stating that the authors of the \"Cold Fusion\" papers of \nrecent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually \nleft the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a \nreview of the research notes of the \"cold fusion scientists\" actually \nproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.\n\nYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay \ntexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food \ncombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.\nBut some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent \noxidative damage in the body).\n\nYour experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove \nthat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you \nuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees \nI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in \ncommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this \nkind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I \ncouldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really \nguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is \nthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to \nproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so \nthey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. \n\nChemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and \nin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve \nfusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we \nreally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with \nsilicon?  Not in my book Robert.\n\nSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation \nthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon \nbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I \nknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to \nseparate the fiction from the fact.\n\nSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in \nhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing \nthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know \nabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not \nbecause silicon is transformed into calcium).\n\nAlmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective \ntissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show \nthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective \nfactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, \nthe more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity \nwhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as \npart of the ageing process in humans).\n\nFor bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which \ncalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon \nin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the \nbone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.\nElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming \ncells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in \nthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency\n(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of \ndefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also \nanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  \nundetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not \ntransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing \nobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into \ncalcium is an interesting little trick.\n\nBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and \nyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without \na very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group \nare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any \nbetter).\n\nIf the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, \nI'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources \nthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems \nto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm \ngoing to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us \nkindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.\n\nFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's \ninteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric \nneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his \nname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in \nour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with \nbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses\"unconventional\"\ntreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one \ncase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional \ntreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the \ncost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between \nradiation treatment and surgery is guys? \n\nI'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the \nchronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)\nand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which \ndo not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it \nbecause candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?\nHow about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your \nsinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).\n\nMarty B."

People with early life hernias\nare felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias.\nThe hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.  \nHowever, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is \nhigh enough that it ought to be repaired.

Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment is\ngenerally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections\nusually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the\ncase with your wife.\nThyroxin orally does \"shut down the thyroid\" through a feedback loop\ninvolving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary \"thinks\" that the\ncorrect amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to\ntell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have\nHashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin\nfor approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills\nfor 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal.\nI still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear.\nThe pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at\nbeginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at\nleast require closer monitoring of hormone levels.\nThyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness,\nand weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart),\nchanges in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things.\n\nI am not a doctor, so I'm sure I mistated something, but the important\nthing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they\naren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. Get a\nsecond opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explain\nthings in detail to you and your wife.\n\n- Eileen Bauer"

        "content": "I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to \nposting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to \ndelete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send \nit back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.\nSince digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all \nday for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has \nthem).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and \nMorgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to \npoint out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical \ncommunity.\n\nDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long \ntime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've \nalready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.\nNow I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in \nthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).\n\nWhen vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as \nthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have \ndecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C\n(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is \nalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).\nThe NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if \nvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in \nboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).\n\nVitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and \nbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene \nis the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-\ncarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present\n(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other \ntissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human \nadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We \nare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about \n30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they \nwere born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that \nof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is \nnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient \nreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of \nvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet \nsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A\n(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National \nResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the \nRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to \n7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was \nkilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main \nreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient \nreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to \nmove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move \ntowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have \nsome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely \nimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that \nbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the \n1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the \ndietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the \n1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill \nthe reserves).\n\nWe know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a \nnormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient \nreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.\nBut for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how \nmuch somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has \noverfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol \nlevel(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your \nliver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal \nrange of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is \ndiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation \nof Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level \nof vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to \nvitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative \napproach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in \nthis post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty \nof warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, \nredness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).\n\nI tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they \nhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear \nsigns that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient \nneeds the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you \nwill always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for \nPMS studies).\n\nBeta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will \nnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to \nretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the \nliver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But \ntaking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to \nfill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% \nthat only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One \nother problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not \nconvert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the \nenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of \nretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will \ncause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.\n\nNow what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body \nuses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be \nnailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde\n(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the \nretinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses \nretinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells \nand the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, \none of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the \ntitle of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play \na role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role \nis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake \nof vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But \nretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once \nit's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC \ngroup wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.\n\nMost people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are \nhelping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and \nthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do \nthemselves more harm than good.\n\nRetinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.\nIn the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus \nproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from \nentering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the \"first \nline\" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown \nto act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which \nstimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration \nand cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters \nare not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not \nnormally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.\nThis is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials \nin progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.\n\nChronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that \nvitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who \nwalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be \nworked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already \nhas on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my \ncourse at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic \nmedical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.\n\nDark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night \nvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The \nserum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver \nreserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have \ntrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled \nout).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels \nwere measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below \n20ug/dl.\n\nAs more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of \nthe U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably \nsee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low \nserum retinol levels.\n\nWhat do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts\nfrom their book:\n\nVitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for \ngrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for \nreproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie \nmalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and \nmetabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, \nwhich has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not \nin reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A \nstatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal \nrange for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are \nindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater \nthan 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation \ntests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to \nperform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to \nvitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The \nbronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal \ntract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than \n7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts \nover 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, \nerythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois\n(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  \n\nThey recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A \ndeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol \nlevel is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in \nadults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule \nout a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical \nlab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give \nthem the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity \nshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the \npatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.\n\nBoth Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.\nRecall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.\nI don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to \nfill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the \nserum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the \nvitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a \ndemonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will \nprovide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status \nare good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more \nagressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But \nvitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could \nbecome pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human \nfetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is \n18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on \nthe human fetus.\n\nCould just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes \nbut the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use \nretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it \nfull.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to \nprescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup \njumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A \nsupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I \nthink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market \nbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general \npublic about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.\n\nMarty B."

The \ntypes of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells \nand these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing \nprocess.

Note that weight gain is usually\na symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid\ncondition is present.\n\nI don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output,\nbut I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is\ncaused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical\nimbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular\neveryday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the\nbody at all.\n\nThe pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)\non the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 -\none is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in\nthe liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other\nhormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the\nbody's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but\nthe liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in\nshort order.\n\nGood sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's\nreference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)\nand the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local\nlibrary).\n\nI hope this has been of some help.\n\n-Eileen Bauer"

Did somebody piss you off at one time?\n\n\n\n|>  On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place\n|> bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic...\n\n\n\nI agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely\nto make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component\nof an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an\nimportant contribution to good health.  It is important to\nexercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).\n\nChromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase\nlean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the\nstatistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.\n\nChromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of\nthe essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role\nin \"sensitizing\" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.\nWeight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity\nto insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose\nweight (4).\n\nInsulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards\nprotein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This \"protein sparing\"\neffect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets\nas insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle\nand organ tissue.  By \"sensitizing\" muscle to insulin,\nchromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters\nso that they \"burn\" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation\nof lean body mass has an important long-term positive\neffect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the\nfat they've lost.\n\nChromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding\nthe thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.\nInsulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability\nof food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin \nstimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say\nthat chromium picolinate increases metabolism.\n\nIn summary, you need to change your life style in order to\nloose weight and stay healthy:\n\n  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.\n     - Eating fat makes you fat.\n\n  B. Increase dietary fiber\n     - low in calories; high in nutrients.\n\n  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week\n     - burn calories.\n\n  D. Take chromium picolinate daily\n     - lose fat; keep muscle\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater\ncan cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are\npotentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall\ncorrectly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses\ninvolves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which\nis a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with\nsulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic\nglutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts\nattacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic\nnecrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the\ndelay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver\ndamage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.\n\nAs to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams\nof acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably\ncause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.\n\nBob Schmieg"

None of his A-1 through A-5\nantineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against\nexperimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against\nleukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce\ntoxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth\nof the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)\n\nBurzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1\nand A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been\nextracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually\ndistinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10\nagainst a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines\nfrom tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and\nsmall-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous\nsystem, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited\nneither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.\n\nIt is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's\ntheory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to\nPAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying\npeptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for\nantineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1\nmixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a\nchemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically\nextremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are\nhabit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects\nof thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10\ndoes not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce\nteratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.\n\nMany of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early\nresearch, past and present support by others for his work have been\nshown to be untrue.\n\n\nsdb\n---\nsdb@ssr.com"

See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).\n\nYou can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the\nClassic Example, but there are probably others.\n\nIridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By\nlooking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises\nyou are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.\n\nThe two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:\n\n1: How does it work?\n\n2: What evidence is there?\n\nThe answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to\nevaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on\nreflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the\norgans of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are\nsupposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or\nenergy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.\n(Always beware the words \"channel\" and \"energy\" in any spiel put out\nby an alternative practitioner.)\n\nThe answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is\nanecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in\nmainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of\nrich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done\nand papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.\n\nThe word \"licensed\" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by\nwhom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and\nrequires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong\nplants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove\nand Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license\nextends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be\ntold that it means \"(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist\".\n\nBTW, the usual term is \"herbalist\".  Why use a different word?\n\n-- \nPaul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).\t    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245\n--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------\nThese ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is not\nfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions"

Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,\nbiochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic\npersistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular\ncarcinoma.\n\nMost cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of\na viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be\ndetermined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It\nconsists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting\nplate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast\nto chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, \nbridging necrosis, or fibrosis. \n\nCPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and\nCPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed\nout, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have\nit. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing\nareas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe\nit is a continuum.

Med. on the \ntopic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a \nvery refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving \nthat manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in \npointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better \nprogress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their \ntechingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation \nto relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or \nbetter than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not just \nthe woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA \neditors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove \nitself to the medical community.\n\nI'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which \nhas supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support \nnutrition education and research.  I've pointed out, in a grant proposal, \nthat the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and \nmanipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing \nonly drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs \nduring his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a \nbetter way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being \nworse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body, \nhe developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his \nstudents in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17.\nStill used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he \nused diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic \nProfession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to \nspeak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little \nunderstanding of how diet affects human health.  This has to change.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU COllege of Osteopathic Medicine\n\n\"You are what you eat.\""

Some studies suggest \nthat early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial \nbecause exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and \nmortality(mumps, measles. etc.).\n\n> -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?\n> How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

But many viruses \nmutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(\nnew antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline \nwith time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.\nChronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression \nbut this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.\n\n> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\n> term effects?\n\nYes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good \nbacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects \nof this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the \nmedical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects \nof chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).\n \n> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\n> normal, and what does one do about it?\n\nChronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my \nopinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is \nnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many \ninfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some \nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \nassociated with the infection.\n\n> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\n\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also \nbe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a \nnutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(\nlike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.\nMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's \nwhat you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves \nnutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training \nneeded to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good \nfor getting general dietary advice from however.\n\n> Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much\n> appreciated.

Cold virus mutate easily.\nHowever, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these\ndiseases, so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold,\nwe make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp \nat night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net).\nThat's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her\noff antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would\nhave antibiotics.

My doctor started using one recently, and I\nthought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  \n\nThe thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.\nThe ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point\nthe thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear\nto straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then\npushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.\nIt is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on \nyourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,\nand may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  \n\nI talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,\nand she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give\nme some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion\nfeels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly\non one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to\nthe company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company\nhad told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end\nof the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior\nto reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree\nof the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.\n\nI have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the\nprobe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you\nhave to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button\nto get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect\nthat many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for\nyet another reason.\n\nIn short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe\nit doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature."

And, much as it discomforts us, in\nhumans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and\ncranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.\nDomestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:\nmy family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-\ngrandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife\nhad each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-\ngrandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous\nfarmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of\nchildbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,\ncontain quite a few gravestones like \"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and\nbaby, May 6, 1853.\"\n\n>You wanted\n>to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a\n>thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage,\n\nMore like one in ten.

But it is often fatal, when it happens out of\nreach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.\n\nClearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine\ndesign); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.  \n\n>You have your kids where you want.

Although\nI can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked\nthem up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.\nI wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly\nindicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting\nuntil an emergency to give in.\n\nAnd bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.\nWe talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main\ndecisions were really hers.\n\n>But I for one am bothered by your continued\n>suggestions, especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first\n>time, that birth is dangerous, even fatal, and that all these\n>unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing\n>it naturally.\n\nI don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that\na first-time mother should have her baby at home.\n\n>I'm no Luddite.

As I understand, these are all short term.\n\nI second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say\nwhat type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say\nhow long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for\nmonths before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are \nevery other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.\nAnother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start\nazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug\nin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics\nabout options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of \ndisease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it\nis worth.  \n\nI treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good \npatient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things\ncan be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and\nColitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637\ninfo hotline.\n\nBest of Luck to you.\n\nSteve Holland.\ngila005@uabdpo.dpo.uab.edu"

The second question is something that's been\nknown for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting\nsmoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the\nperson who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the\ninterim!).

It is interesting\nmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in part\nby the \"normal\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in\nabsence of this, laterality can be \"random.\" People with situs\ninversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their\nrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they\ncan't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong\nside). \n\nAccording to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal\nrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in four\nin a family would be affected. But there may be much more current\ninformation on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking\nabout more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your\npediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of\nwhich there is probably one at NCSU.\n\n-km"

        "content": "I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,\n(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\nI generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\nonly \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have\nany more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\nto have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \nlegs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\nI'm frequently in severe pain.\n\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\n(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\n\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd \nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\n\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because\nI have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\nbut I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\na reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\nI can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\nI've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\nI reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\nthey either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?\nMy doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\npain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\nsuccinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.\n\nAnyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\n\nJanice Rathmann"

In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.\n-- \nGary H.

All too many patients read the insert and panic and then\non the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug\nand we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably\ndidn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit\nthey wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or\nsomething.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they\nreport every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating\nthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough\nliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to\nhappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information\non a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the\nAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.\nThere are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.\nPatients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks\nto themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to \"go ballistic\",\nbut so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been\nreported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume\nit could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will\nrefuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for\nPDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with\ntools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.\nI am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the\ndomain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions\nabout migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.\nFor common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help\nquite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the\ncomputer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,\nphysicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,\nas is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked\nthings that the patients should have found out from their physician\nbut didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.\nSometimes the patients are afraid to ask.

We are philosophically opposed to those, and I don't keep \nup with that particular field.\n\n=====================================================\n\nHoward Doyle\ndoyle+@pitt.edu"

The compiler of \n          this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his \n          First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the \n          subjects of his choice. \n\n\n          ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store.  \n          MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food \n          Store.  What is important is HOW they are used, and what \n          else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )\n\n\n          (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. \n               1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind \n          at a time, preferably grapes. \n               2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half \n          raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape \n          clean the intestinal linings. \n               3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice \n          you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune \n          juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from \n          concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to \n          your home bathroom.) \n               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and \n          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS \n          CONTAIN LAETRILE.). \n               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from \n          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and \n          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  \n          Drink one glass per hour.\n          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day \n          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH \n          PULP.] \n               6th day: Same as 5th day. \n               7th day: Same as 6th day. \n               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each \n          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, \n          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n\n          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. \n               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to \n          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the \n          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n      \n          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.\n               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple \n          cider \"flavored\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a \n          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  \n          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a \n          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal \n          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially \n          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a \n          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. \n        \n          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]\n               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level \n          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  \n          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely \n          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt \n          (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. \n               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising \n          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your \n          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, \n          chomping your teeth together, etc.. \n               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes \n          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the \n          book \"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\", by Frances Nixon, 1973. \n               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should \n          prepare it and drain it.\n          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away \n          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly \n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \n          other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \n          a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an \n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" \n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".]\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \n          \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published \n          bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the \n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \n          present at those times).\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \n       \n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \n       \n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \n               about 2 months. \n        \n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \n\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \n               day.\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \n\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \n               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST \n               \"A.I.D.S.\", which is really a form of cancer similar to \n               leukemia.]  (See the book \"Life Extension\", by Durk \n               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) \n\n               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \n               several times per day.\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \n               described above. \n\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \n\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \n               magnetic fields. \n\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \n               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics \n               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos \n               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! \n\n               INTERFERON tablets.\n\n               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). \n           \n               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical \n               problems (even drug addiction!). \n\n               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure \n               prostate trouble. \n\n               This list is NOT exhaustive. \n\n\n          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-\n          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent \n          and cure many other medical problems including heart-\n          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work \n          effectively. \n\n          Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these \n          remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send \n          a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it \n          to CURE the cancer. \n\n          In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, \n          then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies \n          described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast), \n          BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations \n          and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer \n          treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!]. \n          \n          \n          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources \n          that have shown themselves to be reliable.

I still believe\nthat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would\nnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent\nthe many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.\nAnd 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that \nwould help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank\ngoodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine\nthat helps me.  \n\nI think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you\nwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second\nopinion, and then move on with your life.\nJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in \nthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.\nThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over\nthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going\nto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was \nhelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very\nunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,\nmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.\n\nA recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what\nI'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not\na put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are\nonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us\nout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing\npiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\n\nI guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things\nthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,\nor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because \nthose things are much more tangible and have much more concise \ndefinitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to\ndecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to\nfind your way out of it.\n\n\nI have chosen the latter.\n\n\nLinda\nlindae@netcom.netcom.com\n\n\n>\n>-- \n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\n>geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\" \n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n\n\tIf you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\n\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding\n\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\n\truns the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\n\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\n\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\n\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\n\n\tThe two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.\n\n\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\n\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\n\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\n\tserver can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings\n\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,\n\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\n\tor bugging your vendor.\n\n\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\n\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.\n\n\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\n\n    2. X terminals\n\n\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\n\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\n\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\n\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\n\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\n\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\n\n    3. NeXT\n\n\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\n\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\n\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\n\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\n\n    4. Silicon Graphics\n\n\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\n\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't\n\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not\n\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\n\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\n\tdetails.\n\n    5. IBM RS/6000\n\n\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\n\tUnfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\n\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\n\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\n\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\n\tworks.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||\n\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\n\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\t\t\t\t    ||\n    \n    6. Other stuff\n\n\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\n\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\n\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\n\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\n\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\n\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\n\n\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\n    Sales offices all over the place.\n\n    Availability: February, 1993\n    Price: $219\n    Supports: Mac only\n\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\n\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\n\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\n\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from\n    TidBITS available there.\n\n\nFlexPro Keyboard\n    Key Tronic\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\n\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\n    Price: $489 (?)\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\n\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's\n    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both\n    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.\n    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.\n\n    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will\n    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.\n\n\nDragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)\n    Dragon Systems, Inc.\n    320 Nevada Street\n    Newton, MA  02160\n\n    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200\n    Fax: 617-527-0372\n\n    Shipping: Now.\n\n    Price: DragonDictate-30K -- $4995 (end user system)\n\t   DragonWriter 1000 -- $1595 / $2495 (end user/developer system)\n\t   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.\n    \n    Compatibility: 386 (or higher) PC only\n\t\t   (3rd party support for Mac)\n\n\tFree software support for X windows is also available -- your\n\tPC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a\n\tserial cable or network.

You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.\n    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between\n    words.

The thumbs have\n    a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles\n    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is\n    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.

You can rearrange the three\n    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).

Some use sound hardware to\n \nwarn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.\n\nOften, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has\na delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing\nall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.\nThese tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their\nwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your \nbody to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.\n\n \n    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tBright Star\n\tTel: +1 (206) 451 3697\n    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows\n    Description:\n\tProvides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. \n\tWarns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations\n\ton posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best \n\twith sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible\n\tto record your own messages to warn of break.\n \n    Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)\n    Available from:\n\tMedia Vision\n\tTel: +1 (510) 226 2563\n    Platforms: PC\n    Description:\n\tA sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.\n\tIncludes 'At Your Service'.\n \n    Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tEscape Ergonomics, Inc\n\t1111 W. El Camino Real\n\tSuite 109\n\tMailstop 403\n\tSunnyvale, CA\n\tTel: +1 (408) 730 8410\n    Platforms: DOS\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or\n\tafter a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.\n\tIt gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from\n\ta set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work\n\tyou do - data entry, word processing, information processing.\n\tExercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on\n\thow to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.\n\n\tCHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use \n\tto learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information\n\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\n\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\n\n\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\n\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\n\tuseful when used with Windows.\n\n\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\n\n    Comments:\n\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\n\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\n\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff\n\tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers,\n\tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company \n\tto pay up for RSI management tools.  \n\n    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tRAN Enterprises\n\tOne Woodland Park Dr.\n\tHaverhill, MA  01830, US\n\tTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally\n\tdisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are\n\tanimated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the\n\tcorrect rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training \n\texercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions\n\tyou do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help \n\ton workplace ergonomics.  \n\n\tQuote from their literature:\n\n\t\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic\n\tsets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work\n\tall parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent\n\tRepetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve\n\tyour peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these\n\thelp you to become more relaxed and productive.\"\n \n\t\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.\n\tGodnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup\n\tfor a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to\n\tpromote healthy and efficient computer use. \n\t\n\tCost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts\n\tfor resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).\n \n    Comments:\n\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\n\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\n\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\n\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\n\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\n\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\n\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\n\tone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not\n\trequire any sound hardware.\n\n    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tVisionary Software\n\tP.O. Box 69447\n\tPortland, OR  97201, US\n\tTel: +1 (503) 246-6200\n    Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break\n\twith dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises\n\tto do during breaks, and information on configuring your\n\tworkstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;\n\tquantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is\n\tbought in from another company, apparently; not sure how\n\tequivalent this is to the Mac version.\n\t\n\tThe Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher \n\tMagazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful \n\t2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with \n\treferences.\n \n    Tool: StressFree (commercial software, free usable demo)\n    Available from:\n\tLifeTime Software\n\tP.O. Box 87522\n\tHouston\n\tTexas 77287-7522, US\n\tTel: 800-947-2178 (US only)\n\tFax: +1 (713) 474-2067\n\tMail: 70412.727@compuserve.com\n\n\tDemo (working program but reduced functions) available from:\n\t    Compuserve: Windows Advanced Forum, New Uploads section, or \n\t\t\tHealth and Fitness Forum, Issues At Work section. \n\t    Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)\n\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway)\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). \n\tDisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are\n\tanimated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the\n\tcorrect rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones\n\tare included to some extent.  Online help.\n\n\tVersion 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based\n\ton this.\n\n\tCost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.  \n              Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.\n\t      (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).\n \n    Comments:\n\tI have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface\n\tdesign is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.\n\texpensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only\n\ttool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it\n\ton your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!\n\tDoes not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does \n\thave the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,\n\twhich is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.\n\n    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)\n    Available from:\n\tEmail to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)\n    Description:\n\tThis is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you\n\tto stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously\n\ttyping.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n\tcan start typing again.  \n\n\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n\tfeedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so\n\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n\tfor the next appointment.\n\n\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n\tfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with\n\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n\twith RSI exercises.\n\n\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\n\n\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n\tyourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI \n\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n\tmanually or automatically.  \n\n\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n\tare doing.\n\t\n    Comments:\n\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\n\twarning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)\n    Description:\n\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n\tOnly works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\n\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \n\n-- \nDan Wallach               \"One of the most attractive features of a Connection\ndwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces\nOffice#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet.\" -- CM Paris Ref.

This kind of critical appraisal\n>and comparison, together with the inappropriateness of existing\n>methodologies for new fields of study, is what drives the evolution of\n>methodologies and how we think about them.  \n\nAs usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not\nwilling to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which\nis that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest\npurpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.  \n\nThis is like saying that the most important aspect of business management\nis accurate bookkeeping.  \n\nIf science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it\nwould be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What\nwas the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the\nmethodology of Jenner and Pasteur?  \n\n\nIn an earlier article, Russell Turpin writes:  \n\n>None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should\n>open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science.\n>Modern advocates of homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional\n>Chinese medicine receive little respect because, for the most\n>part, they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research\n>Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty.  (This does\n>*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does*\n>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are\n>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and\n>which are not.)\n\nFirst of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I\ndon't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,\nhomeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be\naccepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of\nhomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  \n\nWhat some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things\n(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific\nattention.  \n\nIf in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not\nuse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is\neffective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all\nof current science is based on the past work of scientists whose\nmethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  \n\nIt is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine\nthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is\nalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on \nthose early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous \nfashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  \n\nBut to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is\ncapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no\nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly\nbe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as\ndoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in\nreason.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

As soon as you possibly can.  The\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\nthese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\n\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\na wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\".\n\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):\n(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\n\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\n\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\nconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\ntenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \"the problem.\"\n\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.\n\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\nthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,\nyou're completely restricting your blood flow.\n\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\nand the cycle continues.\n\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\n\nAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\nergonomics, only make things worse.\n\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\ninflamed, and you've got your problem.\n\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\nwith repetitive activity.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\n\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\n\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\n\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\nIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\nthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\ncalm down, and relax.\n\nIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\n\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best\nfor you.\n\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\n\n. Let your shoulders relax.\n. Let your elbows swing free.\n. Keep your wrists straight.\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\n. Don't slouch or slump forward.\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\n\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\n\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\nfootrest.\n\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\narea.\n\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\n\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\n\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\nname says it all.\n\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\n\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\nshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\ndeviated hands.\n\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\n\n==5== Requests for more info\n\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\nis incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.\n\nIf you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\nwonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the\nabove sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.\n\n==6== References\n\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

This indicates confusion between \"proof\" and the process\n>of doing science.  \n\nYou are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make.\nI fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the\n*process* of science and the end result.  \n\nAs an end result of science, one wants to get results that are\nobjectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the\n*process* of science.  \n\nIf good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\nto homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\nBut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This\nis where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one\nmust have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere\ncollection of empirically validated random hypotheses.\n\nExperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but\nthey are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most\nimportant part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.  \nWithout this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No,\nhypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.\nNor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or\nlooking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really\ngood thinking beforehand.)  \n\nThe difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre\nscientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.  \nIt depends on the quality of their THINKING.  \n\nIt really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that\nthey are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical\nstudies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as\ncertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, \nbut mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  \n\nAnd I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that\nscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding\nmistakes doesn't get you anywhere.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

        "content": "I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in\nnetwork newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going\nto describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced\na seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted\nFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like\nthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the\nfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision\nwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.\n\nWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had\na bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am\nembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once\nin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \"Oh, oh, this is the\nsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\"  Ten \nminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure\nto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.\n\nWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for\nthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now\nafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even\nhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I\nunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.\n\nOnce again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good\nto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any\nexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical\ncommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and\nfoods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can\nguess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas\nanyone out there has.

See his book, \"Discovering\".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don't think \"extra-scientific\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the \"Newton of mirror-image life,\" which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Some systems are moving\ntowards eventually implementing filtration systems but are\nexpected to miss the law's deadline.\n   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already\na reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface\nwater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent\nof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism\ncryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite\ncalled giardia.\n   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office\nstudy released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee\nChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the\nnation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary\nsurveys of water systems.\n   \"This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions\nof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be\nassured that their water is safe to drink.

In most of this thread, I have\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\nwhat is not. \n\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\ndo this.  \n\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \n\n> If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\n> to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\n> But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.

Let's face it: we cannot\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\nclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to\nplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \n\nRussell"

Such \"extra-\n>rational\" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\nIn article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com \n    (Dick King) writes:\n>  [ Somebody writes: ]\n>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....\n>  ....\n>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a\n>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.\n>         ....\n>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out\n>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it's not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\"\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's\nassertion that current scientific methods \"avoid all known errors.\")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

There is such\na wide variation between people with respect to what causes their\nheadaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned\nabout mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.\n\nI don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer).\nDehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before\nplaying rather than after.\n\nBeing in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.\n\nI've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in \ndescending order of importance):\n\n1) Heavy exercise\n2) Sleep deprivation\n3) Fasting\t\t(e.g., skipped breakfast)\n4) Physical trauma\t(e.g., head bonk)\n\nHeavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I \ndon't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of \nthe other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered \nthis, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two \nor three years when I get cocky (\"It's been so long, maybe I just don't \nget them anymore\") and stop being careful.\n\nHope this is helpful.\n\nJohn."

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

The crucial\nthing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use\nunless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists\nwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit\nout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.\n\n(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\nelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\nhe'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\n\n>It further at least implicitly advances the position that\n>sciences goes \"forward\" (and it is not clear what this means given the\n>context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\n>and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\n>weeded out via the \"critical function\" of science.\n\nI'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\n\n>(Though why this critical\n>function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\nLysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\n\n>If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\n>subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\n>of the application of any \"critical function\" concerning replication.\n>This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \"anything goes\" view.)\n\nI don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\nculture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.

Perhaps\nyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out\nfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first\nadvanced from logical grounds.

At this point I\nwas pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering\nhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told\nme that he just doesn't have time to \"rap with patients\" and thought\nthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to\n\"rap\" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through\non his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he \nfelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his\npatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me\nthis apology: \"I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you\nmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you\nbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot of\ntime to deal with that.\"  He then told me to call him the next day\nfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.\n\nI am still upset and have not yet called.\n\nMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?\n(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to\nbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?\nIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type\nof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but\nnow I am afraid to call him.\n\n\t\t\t--Marlena"

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\naddress below.  \nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\n\n\n\n  \n\n#######################################################################\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\n#######################################################################\n\n\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

Miracle\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\nsour as well.\n\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\n\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to\nchronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is\nsomething to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much\nmore frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an\nautimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which\nalso leads to cirrhosis.  \n\nOf course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous\neffects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. \nPatients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,\namong many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic\ncirculation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of\nhyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. \nThese effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in\nmen, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for\ncirrhosis is liver transplant.\n\nKeep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in\nyour friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the\nsubject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.

Biomedical research doesn't make any basic \nassumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific\nresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis\nand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than \n\"the old Newtonian model of the world\".

The\narcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions\nare particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the\nblood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin,\nwhich controls the release and flux of steroids governing development,\nespecially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less\nsensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu,\non a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood\nlevels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release\nof steroids becomes flattened.\n\n                    Hope this helps.\n                    --Dianne Murray: wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca"

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,\nI only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I\nestimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.\n\nVery little sugar or salt.\n\nVery high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are\nrecommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard\nof people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can\ncontain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as\nlikely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are\njust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)\n\nMy \"clean your plate\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last\n10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch\nup, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.\n\nI don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry\nshortly, and eating won't be practical then).\n\nI bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to\nstores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.\nI estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps\nbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes\nruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my\nmetabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable\nwith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if\nit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess\nounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that\nweigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim\nweight from the rider than from the vehicle.)\n\nThere's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically\ndifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,\nit isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.\n\nObviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've\ndone will have the success I did.

Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.\n\nI'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.\nI usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,\nmy weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.

Dr. Teperman \ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our \nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \nDr. Teperman. \n\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\n\n\nLAST MEETING\n\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \nher for an entertaining evening.\n\n\n\nANNUAL MEETING\n\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \nslate for the Board.\n\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\n\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\n\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\n\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \nmembers and there is plenty of work. \n\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\n\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\n\nFUTURE MEETINGS\n\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \n\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\n\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \n\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\n\nNOTDAW\n\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \n\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\n\nDR. STARZL TO BE HONORED \n\nThe Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will \nhold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the \nFountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas \nStarzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and \nare going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne \nTreffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.\n\nMEMBERSHIP NEWS \n\nCongratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant \nin Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing \nwell after only 12 days in hospital.\n\nArthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston \nMarathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation \nworks!  We hope the national press notices. \n     \nBob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his \ntransplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis \nand feeling better.  \n\nNicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, \nspent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems \nencountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  \nThey are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will \ncontinue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. \n\nKay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall \nthat resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a \ncandidate for the Board so we need her well soon.\n \nAnd best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough \nwinter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.\n\nSEE YOU......WEDNESDAY   APRIL 14  8 PM   K of C UNIONDALE            \n                   DR. LEWIS TEPERMAN"

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of\naspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise,\nsince you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other\ncomponents of food all the time.  In studies involving administration\nof high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable.\nMethanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings,\nsay 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde\nand formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels\ncan damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses\nthe body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one\ntreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on\nethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is\nmetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver.\nIf the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde,\nit is actually relatively non-toxic.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer"

Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there's\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn't expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer"

(To\n>reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from\n>uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical\n>problems are notoriously problematic.)  \n\nOkay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\n\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \n\n\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\nhasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\nresearch then it can't be of any interest to us.\"  \n\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There've got to\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\n\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most \nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \nit doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\nprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to\npractice it over again at home.\n\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \n\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \nfrom scientific acceptance.) \n\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don't have any way of \nknowing that it's effective.\"  \n\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't \nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of \nbooks and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \ndetail as I'm capable of.)  \n\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \nfavorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\n\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \nattitudes about science.  \n\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \nIf so, I apologize. \n \n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

He used a strange technique\nI'd never seen before.\n\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\n\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\n\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\n\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\nand concerns me are:\n\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\n\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\n\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\n    so.\n\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\n\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\n\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\n\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.\n\nAn amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was\ndiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting\na lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.\nThis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.\nThe guy who represented the company in the press conference defended\nhimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day\nfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-\nbroiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my\nimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal\nbroiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!"

Chiropractic: all illness\nstems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such\nsystems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental\nand not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism,\nbecause scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants\nand are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants\nthat have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what \nis meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi,\naccupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that\nprobably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.\n\nPerhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience.\nRhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal\nand his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that \npeople don't want to be associated with that sort of thing.  \n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | \"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\" \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde\n>produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to\n>living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.  \n\n[...]\n\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\n\n   [Reproduced without permission]\n\n\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\n\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\n\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\n\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\n\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\n\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\n\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\n\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\n\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\n\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\n\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\n\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\n\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\n\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\n\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\n\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\n\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\n\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\n\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\n\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\n\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\n\n\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\n\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\n\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\n\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\n\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\n\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\n\tafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm\n\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the\n\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\n\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association's\n\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\n\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\n\tclean bill of health.\n\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\n\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\n\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\n\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\n\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\n\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\n\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\n\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\n\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\n\tof selected foods omitted]\n\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\n\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\n\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\n\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\n\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\n\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\n\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\n\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\n\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\n\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\n\n\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)"

        "content": "KS> From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart)\nKS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome\nKS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg\nKS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information\n\nI'm not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\n\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\n\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\n\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\n\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\nyears.\n\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\nneuropsychologic tests.\n\nMy take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\nwithout PPS complaints).\n---\n .

We will \n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\n;No breeding, no \"hybrids\", etc.  The ethical question is, should\n;we?\n \nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \n1) reducing the gene pool and \n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\n \nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\ndon't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \n \nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\nas no different than anyone else's. But if we could make\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\n\"1984.\"   \n \nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\nhasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\nturns came.\n \nNot that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \n \nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\nmay not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\npull us through. \n \nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\nthus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough. \n \nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the\nSpirit.\n \nSorry for the long post. Got carried away.\n \nBob (ruegg@med.unc.edu)"

It *does*\n>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are\n>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and\n>which are not.)\n\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\nthere's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \n\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is \never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \n\n\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\n\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \n\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a \nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \nobjectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\n\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\ninvestigation.  \n\nIn article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: \n> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that\n> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  \n\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \nspecific question to try and answer.  \n\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \nI certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \nof \"reason and observation.\"\n\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \n\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \nis any existing research related to this question.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

The catalog description is as follows:\n\n\tThe Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager \n\tthat actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a\n\tprofessional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two\n\tcounter-rotating \"thumbs\" that move in one-inch orbits --\n\treleasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.\n\n\tPressure Point Massager    A2623   $109\n\nTo order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or\nfax at 1-800-345-4021.\n\n********\nNOTE:\nWhen I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price\nwas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog\nenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  \nQUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,\nand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it\nlooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the\nfirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a\nreason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to\nship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could \nuse the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old \none.  VERY reasonable people.\n********\n\nI have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I \nwould be described as \"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches \nand exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  \nIf, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough\ntime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, \nmore prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require \nphysical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit \nto get the prescription for p.t.  \n\nThe tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache\n(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my \nphysical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles \nin particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the \nheadache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to \nwhile it is being massaged.\n\nI ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing\nsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my \nneck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in \nthe past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient \np.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up \nin the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.\n\nI have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base\nunit is about a 14\" x 9\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\" high, with handles on each\nside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \"thumbs\" are about \n1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs \nare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more \ntoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in \neither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side \nof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either\nside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck\nor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.\n\n\n                 _______________________________\n                |  __    _______________    __  |\n                | |  |  |\t\t|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |\t\t|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |\n                | |__|\t\t\t   |__| |\n                |_______________________________|\n\n\nFor the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if \nlaying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or \nneck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or\nstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are\nalso impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I \ndon't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works \nwell for me.\n\nFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager\nbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or\nnot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  \nIf I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches \nwhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use \nthan the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together \n(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and \nmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than \nnothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are \nnot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't \npin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this \nis to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple \nconsiderations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.\n\nNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion \nfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my\nneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard\nagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a\nfew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  \nAfter that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, \nthe pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  \nI also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the \nmost vulnerable point for me.\n\nIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,\nalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at\na time) to really work it out.\n\nI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I\ncannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had\nit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also \nto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have\nbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this \nwas very timely  for me.\n\nThis is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently\nbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been\nin business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,\nwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog\nproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought\nput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones\nI've seen such as \"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\" or \"Mature Wisdom\".\nI'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no\nbig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, \nparticularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.\n\nI apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would \nlike to know before ordering something thru the mail.\n\n\nRobin Coutellier                   \nNorthern Telecom, Mountain View, CA\nINTERNET: robin@ntmtv.com\nUUCP:portal!ntmtv!robin"

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by \nperforming studies that are \"blind\" in various ways.  Some of these\nare:\n\n  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a \n     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the\n     control group or the test group.\n\n  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects \n     receive a placebo or the test treatment.\n\n  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects\n     receive a placebo or the test treatment.\n\nObviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to \ndifferentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis\nis quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on\nwhich it is based so that others can verify it.  \n\nIt is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are\nanimals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because\nthose who performed the study did not \"blind\" themselves.  It is not\nconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already\nare, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,\nthe control and test groups are treated alike.\n\nRussell"

It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n\"mainly about.\"\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.

As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.

When\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\nresearchers' minds.  \n\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.

We're talking prudent policy in\n>infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.\n\nWho said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that\norally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all\nneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median\neminence. These areas are responsible for the production of\nhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal\ndevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now\nwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain\nnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?\nAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,\nANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for\ncontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? \n\nHow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to\n\"sacrifice\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\nindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine\nand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be\nuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on\npsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and\nphysiology.\n\nI suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities\n(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its\nimplication for adults (me).  Certainly\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\nendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*\nattained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. \n\n>>Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you\n>>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles\n>>disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever. \n>\n>You mean \"asserting\".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just\n>plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily\n>have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential\n>for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything\n>whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any\n>studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious\n>reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon\n>of the \"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\".  It says nothing about the frequent\n>inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.\n\nOlney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some\nsensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally\nadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone\nfluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant\nsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient\nrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is\nresponsible not only for control of growth during development, but\nalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of\nheadaches? I don't know.\n\n>>>dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com \n>>Hmm. \".com\".

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32\nalternative health therapies.]\n\n  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the\n  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\n  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in\n  highly variable colour patterns.\n\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\n\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\n  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\n\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\n  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\n  the actual object itself.\n\n  [...]\n\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\n\n\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \"Reality shopping; a\nconsumer's guide to new age hokum.\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\nvNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for\nevaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples\nof hokum.]\n\n  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of\n  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian\n  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.\n  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings\n  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious \"auras\" or even\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,\n  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous\n  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of\n  the unknown.\n\n-- \nPeter Kaminski\nkaminski@netcom.com"

Hope you can join us.\n\n\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\n\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \nlifetime.  \n\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\n\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \nFoundation's mission is to change that. \n\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.

Limited tinea\npedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as\nwell as systemic medication i.e. tablets. Finally, a self-diagnosis is\nnot always reliable, lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungal\ninfection and requires very different treatment.\n\ngervais"

I was picked from\nmy softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)\nwhich put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get\nan equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To\ncontrol the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since\nI was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think\nI foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people\nlike me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are\nnot used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the\nresults of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major\nleague players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test\nwhether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was \"better\" -\nbut I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in\nsaid that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major\nleaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure\nwhether I'd believe her.)\n\nJanice Rathmann"

He's kept a record of the results, and for over \n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\nprogram.\n\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\nsymptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly \nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\n\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\nsorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\nsince that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\n\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\n\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\nto the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough\nactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my\nface that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee\ntheir safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as\nfar as I am concerned.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however.

In some circumstances, though, the    \norganisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    \nintestines, vagina, or skin.

After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\n\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides\n minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  \n\n My questions are: \n\n     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the\n     levels of pain?\n\n     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?\n\n     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?\n\n\n  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.\n  \n  \n  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.\n\n  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup\n  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.\n   \n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nGregory W.

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some\n>claim their heart \"skipped\" beats once in a while.\n\nBoth of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed\nface is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular\npulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in\nthe blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are\nsodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,\none can get too much of a good thing.\n\n>Some reacted with headache, \n\nAgain, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased\nheart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,\nessentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency\nher, necessarily.\n\n\n>some stomach ache.\n\nWell stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not\nnecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting\noccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has\neaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the\nlist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an\nenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly\nache) would be expected.\n\n\n> Some had watery eyes or running nose,\n\n\nThese are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar\nto vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious\ncompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible\nsome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the\nsymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets\ncan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be\nnecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person\nwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration\nand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from\nsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.\n \n> some\n>had itchy skin or rashes. \n\nPeople respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends\nupon what it is about the compound that \"pisses off\" their body.\nPollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many\npeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an\nhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,\ncausing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an\nallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that\ncontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can\nperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. \n\n>More serious accusations include respiration \n>difficulty \n\nSee above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory\nproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.\n\nand brain damage. \n\nThe area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system\ncontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling\nthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,\nand other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.\n\n\n>Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one\n>suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food\npoisoning. \n\nAbsolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,\nsay, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus\ntoo much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,\nplus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days\nbefore from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of\nthings.\n\nBut it might be the MSG. \n\n>if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.\n\nIf noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably\nstomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.\n\n\nAnyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their\nresponses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\n\n          Dianne Murray  wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca"

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \n\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \ndiseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise \"disposable needlesused here.\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \nbeing poorly manufactured and too \"sharp\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to \"slide\" past vessels and            \nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that \nhaven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \n\nOf course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \nsite.\n\n\nWhile I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \n\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu"

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). \n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD, \nDenver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. \n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. \n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. \n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). \n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). \n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. \n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. \n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). \n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\n                           Management of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. \n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. \n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n\n---\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na"

Anthony Fauci, director of the \nU.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, \n\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly \ncan with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will \nget around microbial resistance.\"  He said any delay would signify questions \nover safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.

John Tew of the Medical College of \nVirginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument \nfor  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.

This finding \nsupports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of \ncontracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the \nJAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive \nsurgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies \nwere conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and \nFlorida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and \ntested all patients willing to participate.

A6 \n======================================================================   \n\"Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program\" AIDS \nTreatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) \n\n     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of \nHealth has raised questions about the NIH's commitment to an  effort that uses \nunorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the \nOffice time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much \nmore [than  public relations].\" \n======================================================================   \n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \n\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\n6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  \nfound that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, \nwhich is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nkill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 15, 1993 \n     ====================================================================   \n\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care \nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \nchange the future of worldwide health. \n====================================================================   \n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \n\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \nhas been the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\n                                H H S   N E W S\n     ********************************************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n                                March 29, 1993\n\n\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \n\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \n\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \n\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. \n\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \n\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \"We need this \ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \nHIV infection in children.\" \n\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \n\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \n\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \n\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \n\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. \n\n\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \nfevers, for example, than another,\" said Dr. McNamara.  \"We'll also look at \nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects.\"   He emphasized that the small \nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nproducts. \n\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \n\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \nprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \n\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \n\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \nconsidered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will \nbe told what they receive. \n\nIf the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the \nexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will \nbegin. \n\nEach child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six \nmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.  \n\nFor more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call \nthe AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service, 1-800-TRIALS-A, from 9 a.m. to 7 \np.m., EST weekdays.

Although the \nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' \nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \nitself caused the skin disease. \n\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \nRetroviruses. \n\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \n\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \n\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \nanimals. \n\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune \nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \n\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases. \n\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\n                                H H S   N E W S\n                 ********************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                                 March 4, 1993\n\n\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \ninfection or AIDS. \n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \nSan Francisco General Hospital. \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \nanswered as quickly as possible. \n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \nsources of information or materials. \n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \nmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. \n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health \nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA's associate \nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \"Providers who treat people with \nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\" \n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \n\n\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\n\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\n\f\n------------- cut here -----------------\n-- This is the last part ---------------\n\n---\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na"

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard\nScanjet IIp was purchased this week.\n\nThank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:\n\nJohn Sorenson\nCarol Sigelman\nCarla Moore\nBarbara Moose\nJudith Schrier\n\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\n\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \nreview the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted \ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \n\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \nprocessor formats.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3). \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated. \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset. \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children's Hospital and \nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases. \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3). \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6). \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

These finer particles are considered hazardous because \nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \n     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \nlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \nmicrogram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  \n     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory \nDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung \nAssociation's medical section.  \n     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study \nby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles \nmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \nOther studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \nand bronchitis in children.  \n     \"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\" \nsays Dr. Schwartz.  \"But more and more research is showing that particles are \nbad actors as well.\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate \nair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex \nand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nacid aerosols.  \n     \"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects \nof particulate air pollution,\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \"We have no way of \nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \" Consequently, most of what \nis known about particulates has been learned through population-based research \nlike the Seattle study.  \n     Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \ndioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any \ntime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with \nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.\n     \"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only \ncover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's \nrarely particulate matter,\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \"However, PM10 doesn't have \nto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma\n\nThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on \nDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in \ndermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance \ntechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care \nprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological \ncharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, \nand followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi \nand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in \npreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of \npresentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel \nweighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement. \n \nAmong their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a \ndistinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins; \n(2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential \nfor long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical \nexcision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and \nextensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4) \npatients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high \nrisk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely; \n(5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for \nmelanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education \nand screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality \nfrom melanoma. \n \nA copy of the full text of the consensus panel's statement is available by \ncalling the NIH Office of Medical Applications of Research at (301) 496-1143 \nor by writing to:  Office of Medical Applications of Research, National \nInstitutes of Health, Federal Building, Room 618, Bethesda, MD 20892.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 31\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                         NCI-Designated Cancer Centers\n\nThe Cancer Centers Program is comprised of 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers \nactively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer \nincidence, morbidity, and mortality.  Within the program, there are four types \nof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily \nin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on \nclinical research; \"comprehensive\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a \nmultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community \noutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer \nprevention and control research. \n \nAlthough some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was \nthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new \ncancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage \nof the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened \nthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and \ncancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew \nprogressively. \n \nIn 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, \nthere are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria \nfor comprehensive status. \n \nTo attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an \ninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly \nestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for \"comprehensiveness\" include the \nrequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in \nseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong \nprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings \ninto clinical practice. \n \nMoreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly \nbeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also \nreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting \nthe infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass \nstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, \nsignificant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important \noutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of \nsources. \n \nThe other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and \ncapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit \nimportant new findings or address timely research questions. \n \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nOf the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  \nThese centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers \nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory. \n \nClinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and \nclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently \nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \noverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. \n \nFinally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely \nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \ncontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public health \ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \nresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  \nConsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. \n \nTogether, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward \ncreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through \ninterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the \nlaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. \n \nComprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available) \n \nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center\nBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 108\n1918 University Boulevard\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\n(205) 934-6612\n \nUniversity of Arizona Cancer Center\n1501 North Campbell Avenue\nTucson, Arizona 85724\n(602) 626-6372\nInternet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edu\n \nJonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\n200 Medical Plaza\nLos Angeles, California 90027\n(213) 206-0278\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 33\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nInternet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edu\n \nKenneth T.

The \ndecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to \ntest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of \nHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  \nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the \ntherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies \nincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH \nthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is \nintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  \nreplication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's \nreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the \nMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  \n\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the \nnext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\" said Shalala.   \nAdministration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine \nHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had \nconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested \nsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of \nmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two \nyears.\n\n==================================================================    \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. \n114, No. 14, P. 18 \n\n     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, \nthe manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the \ndrug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that \nalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk \nof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  \ndisappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of \nthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the \ndrug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. \nresearchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, \nmany argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients \nexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  \nAIDS symptoms.

There do not\nseem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The\nCopenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF\nstudies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,\nbut like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.\n\nFrom one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in\nthe absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From\nanother (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of\nthe specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache,\ntherefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.\n\nWhether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling\nheadaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic\ncolleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients\nthey can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill\nmy office with patients holding their heads in pain.\n---\n . SLMR 2.1 . E-mail: jim.zisfein@factory.com (Jim Zisfein)"

This disease is \nuniversally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the \ntumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum \nmember checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.  \nHe spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from \nglioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had \naudited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.  \nAfter the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in \nSeptember, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his \noncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of \nshrinkage or necrosis.\n\nThe patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live \npast December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's \ntreatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's \ntreatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these \ntreatments, saying \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"\n\nDr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a \nprotein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it, \nand administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

Given the huge problem of\nunderdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just\nabout every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,\nhe sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not\nthe only orthopedists in the town.\n\nLet's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the\n*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage\nmanifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by\nneurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem\nwe have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD\npatient.\n\nHe refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the\npatient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to\nthe knees).\n\nGordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.\n\n-Marc.\n-- \n--\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Marc C.

Dr. Noordewier has \nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \nto his current work in computational biology.\n\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\n\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \n National Laboratory) \n\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \ntechniques in this domain.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\n\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \nthe field.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\n\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \nare increasingly in evidence.

The critique comes from THE TUFTS\n   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]\n\n\t\"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November\n\t3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In\n\tthe segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley\n\tmakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them\n\t('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently\n\tsick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven\n\tpersonal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the\n\tsubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive \n\tthose studies are.\n\n\tConsider his making reference at the beginning of the program to\n\ta study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order\n\tto back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,\n\ta flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as\n\tin many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT\n\tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on\n\thumans but on rabbits.\n\n\tOne of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist\n\tPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that\n\ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get \n\theadaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably \n\toveremphasized the extent of the problem.'\n\n\tA second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor\n\tat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley\n\tremarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory\n\tanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because\n\tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's\n\tresearch with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human\n\tyoungsters.\n\n\tIn fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's \n\texperiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected\n\textremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing \n\ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,\n\tand when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance\n\tto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither\n\tof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG \n\twith food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by\n\tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little\n\treaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human\n\tblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations\n\tfound in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....\n\n\tThe World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of\n\tthat fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific\n\tCommittee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,\n\thave concluded that MSG is safe.\n\n\tTheir determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never\n\tbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed\n\tto it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a\n\tburning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe\n\tof clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently\n\texonerated the much-maligned substance.\n\n\tThat's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of\n\tmonosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever\n\twe eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one\n\tof the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken\n\tdown into glutamate during digestion.\n\n\tIt's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the\n\tmost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes\n\tup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in\n\tmilk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.\n\n\tThat doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number\n\tof people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore\n\tsensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international\n\tprofessional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus\n\treached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\"\n\n\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)"

Without knowing more it is not\npossible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring,\nor temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there are\nno dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate\nto obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on \nrecurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence from\nrecurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as \nrecurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the\nintestine.  \n\nYour friend should look into membership in the Crohn's and Colitis \nFoundation of America.   1-800-932-2423\n\nGood luck to your friend.\n\nSteve Holland"

Nutrition) and \nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \nquack.  \n\nI've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I \nknow that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at \nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really \ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if \nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \nmedical profession.\n\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\nSteve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \nElaine's doctor a quack.\n\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \n\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \nit's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \nthe candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\nIf it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \nnondiscript.  \n\n\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving \norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \nantibiotics).  \n\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \nduring a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\n \nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out \ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\n\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin \nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved \nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \nseeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. \n \nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 West 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok. 74107\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\"."

I'm\ncertainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I\nagree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammation\ncan be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.\n\nHaving had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough\ncaveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically,\nthe idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be\nrealized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds\nof inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.\nTherefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common\ninflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's,\nof the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:\n\nCompletely out - never again - items:\n\to corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)\n\to popcorn (same)\n\to dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins\n\to nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)\n\nDiscouraged greatly:\n\to raw vegetables (too fibrous)\n\to wheat and raw grain breads\n\to exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)\n\to greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)\n\to little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!)\n\to long grain and wild rice (husky)\n\to beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)\n\to BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing\n\nI was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this\nday and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your\nsystem as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the\nNUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try\nthe ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it again!\nRemember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the\ndaylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more\nthoroughly - you're mileage may vary.\n\nAs with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.

Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\n\n\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\n\n\nIn article banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu writes:\n\n>I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\n>Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \n>Med.

Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible, Steve, and I \n>see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er's?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've\nknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \n>no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \n>balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...  Could it just be\n>professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.\n\nYou've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n>...Humans have all \n>kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small \n>and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.

But any of \n>these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \n>residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \n>happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\n\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \n>Elaine's doctor a quack.\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \n>the candida or not isn't certain.\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \n>nondescript.  \n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt's a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \n>ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \n>they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".

While this low level of vitamin \n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nAren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \n>inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \n>antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \n>just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \n>vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It's like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nAlso, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.

When I finally find a \n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \"live with\nit\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \"you'll just have\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:\n\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

Using \npsychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example, the hallucinations one\nperson experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on\nan acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going\nto happen.  Anyhow, that was a pretty lame example, but hopefully I made my\npoint- it's all a matter of perception, and as long as someone ingesting MSG\nperceives it as causing bad effects, then s/he can definitely experience those\naffects.  On the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in,   or something.  Still, anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff that\nleads to the study being done.\n-Dan"

My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch\nto get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it\nstill hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  \nmuscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be\nbest not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although\nsome suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent \nirritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, \nwait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the\npuncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent\nirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to\ndo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the \nspot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,\nand spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \" apart.)\n\nThis is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few \nconcerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing \nher every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) \nand during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every \n4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. \nAs it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that \nthough I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she \nmentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 \nweeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had \nan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no \nproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain \nin my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very \ndifficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or \nmove unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for \nwhen I do need to go out.) \n\nAnyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from \nthe beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about \n2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  \n(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating \nvery much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well \nnow I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile \nrelated.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my \nupper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I \nwas lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because \nit started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  \nno matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I \nate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had \nturned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if \nI ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it \nwasn't as much of a problem.\n\nSo the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid \nfatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware \nof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have \nbeen avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat \nfoods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  \n\nBut doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat \nexcept fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, \nfried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I \nshould avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only \nhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( \npotatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in \na little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or \nsteamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have \nsome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if \nI'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it \nfrom my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if \nshe's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her \nrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on \ncholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She \noriginally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the \nentire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I \nstarted.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and \nshe's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also \nasked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them \nare.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, \nand feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did \nwant to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be \ntemporary for that one week. \n\nWhat I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I \nwould understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying \nthat anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she \nassumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that \nbecause of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to \nuse the energy from the food I do eat. \n\nAny opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm \ntruly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet \nbecause fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few \nminutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I \ndon't find any foods satisfying.\n\nThanks \n\nG"

Would that many patients be able to tell what\ncauses them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but\nif a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are \ntested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's\ncommonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with\nseverly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.\n\nThere was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed\nthe issue of dietary restriction of fiber.

        "subject": "How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation",
        "content": "I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\n\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \nper day).\n\n\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \n\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\n\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\n\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\n\n\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \n\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\n\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \n\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\n\n\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\n\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \n\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\n\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \nbefore supplementation.\n\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about \nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \nin urinary oxalate excretion.\n\n\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\n\n\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\n\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\n\n\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \n\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\n\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\n\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't \nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \n\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \nformation should be given B6 supplements.\n\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \ncalcium-oxalate.\n\n\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)\n\n\t5. \"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the \ncrystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium \ninteraction\"J.

But not all of them\ndid, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic\nFatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal\nMedicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue\nand Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that\nsome sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.\n\nAstonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively\nswollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's\nnothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the\nsyndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The\ndisagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers\non just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:\npsychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --\nmaybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental\ntoxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of\nthese.\n\nThere's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try\ndifferent things, some of which seem to help.\n\nMassive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.\nPost your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.\n\nNote: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)\ndiseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good\ndoc."

Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no \n\t   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.\n\n\t2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid \n\t   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.\n\n\t3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has \n\t   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by \n\t   the NCI.\n\nThese are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should \nnot committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of \nwhich result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal \nagents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be \nhaving a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of \ncommission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to \nrelieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,\nothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a \nchance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the \nhealer's oath, \"I will do no harm\".  But you know David that very few \ntreatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a \nvery difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each \nphysician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some \nare very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive \napproach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long \nas the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake \nin lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in \nthe medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as \nquacks or even unethical.\n\nWhat do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  \nThese people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the \nfrustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are \nreally doing a pretty good job of providing \"alternative\" medicine.  But \nmany lack any formal training and are in the \"business\" simply to make a \nfew fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting \ncompetent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative \ncare area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find \nsomeone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of \nmoney and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-\nmedical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the \nliscened physicians).\n\nI hope that this clears things up David.\n\nMarty B."

As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.\nThey showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\n\nI've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\n\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\n   water.\n\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\n\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\n\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\nstory here.\n\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\n\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe\nthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that\nthe victim's urine is strangely dense.

If it\nchanges anything. \n\nYou can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you\nhad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave\ncooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's\nhard to digest anyway. \n\nFor comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal \"last\" longer eat pasta or\nrice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe\nsmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the\nbaby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How\ntight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses \nyour middle. Be sure not to \"suck in\" your stomach when sitting, again it\nwill put pressure on the digestive tract. \n\nTry laying on your sides, back,\nand stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.\nEasier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby\n\"turn\" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.\nWhen you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the\ndiaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my\nsecond one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he\ndidn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.\n\n\nMaybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe\nshe just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. \nBut this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something\nto be avoided if possible. \n\nNausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My\nfirst pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble.\nSome articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better\nchance of carrying their baby.

Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an\nopinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. \n\nSometimes a correct diagnosis\ntakes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the\ndisease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have\nsomething that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been\ndescribed yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out,\nsometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment,\nsometimes they find it's incurable.  \n\nThere is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an \nillness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is\nmore like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking. \n\n-Jackie-"

Noring has pointed out\nthe catch-22 that if the \"crazy\" theory were true, you probably couldn't\nfind any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie\nbeasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the\nfellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set\nof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---\nnamely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,\nmany of them appear to get better.  \n\nSo, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,\ncontrolled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any\nbetter than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we\nhave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject\ndisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling\nback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any\nconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  \n\nAnd I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of\npeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything\nin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do\ncontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently\nsincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working\non themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also\nquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's\ncompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine\nscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting\noxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that\ndoesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some\nother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be\ntrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people\nhave been talking about.\n\nBut again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal\nevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some\ncandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,\nit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can\nmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough\nmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind\nstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out\nthe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can\nadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study\nshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.\n\nKen\n--"

        "content": "SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL\n \n    By Laura Pitter\n    TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist\nwhen he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim\ntown of Srebrenica last August.\n    But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody\nwar, he considers himself a surgeon.\n    ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no\nlicense to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives\nnormally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''\n    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,\nthe Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of\nthe horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the\nsuffering of the thousands trapped there.\n    ``I lived through hell together with the people of\nSrebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest\nheroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.\n    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant\nat a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he\nhad never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says\nhe has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for\nguidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without\nanesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean\nsections.\n    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the\nfirst 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000\npatients.\n    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from\nTuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people\ncarried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him\nthrough guerrilla terrain, he said.\n    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells\nlanded within one minute in an area half the size of a football\nfield, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of\nthe dead were women and children.\n    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the\nchildren were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the\nblood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.\n    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not\npiece them together.

Many deaths could have been prevented had\nthe hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.\n    The six general practitioners who had been operating before\nhe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They\ndidn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''\n    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by\nmid-September he had run out of supplies.\n    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes\nthey were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no\nanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain\nbecause it increased bleeding.\n    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and\nstomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were\nimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.\n    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.\n    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived\nfrom the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.\n    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in\nmid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the\nregion. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''\n    Then the hunger set in.\n    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began\nair dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day\nfrom complications associated with malnutrition, he said.\n    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the\npeople from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.\n    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in\nSrebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.\n    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after\nvisiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.\n    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of\npeople standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when\nI left.

        "content": "The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary\non some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries.\nI hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n[Reprinted w/o permission]\n\n\n\"There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries\"\n\nBy Mike Royko\nTribune Media Services\n\n\n     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings \nis right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \nFamilies USA.\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \nthat doctors make too much money.\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \nOK.\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \nand are still simmering.\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \nof Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \ndo are stealing it from them.\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  \nKarl Marx lives.\n     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such \nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \nbecome a physician?\n     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should \nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \na doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a \ndoctor?\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  \"How \nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \nmore until they retire or fall over?\"\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \ncalled together to remake America's health care.\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \nto health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \nmajor cause of high medical costs.\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \na McDonald's?\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \ncabbages.\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \nthey might have been more honest if they had said:\n     \"Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \nproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, \nyou,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you \nguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; \ngetting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the \nmicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into \nthe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot \nvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease \nwhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.\n     \"You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single \nbiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is \namazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.\n     \"In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at \nyour blubbery bods all day.\n     \"So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and \nstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-\ngreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.\"\n     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, \nthere is another solution: Don't use them.\n     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those \nspine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands \nupon your head and declare you fit.\n     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest \npains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit \nthere, and pop in a couple of valves.\n     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that \noverpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house \nthan  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and \nmalpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?\n     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  \nAnd if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on \nhow to give it its shots.\n     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much \npollsters should earn?\n\n\nRoyko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  Media \nServices.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n--\n**********************************************\nVinay J.

The drastic change of environment\nwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even\nyoung people find the change unsettling.\n\nThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -\nanaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the\nelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the\nchange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have\ntried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the\npatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of\nthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these\npatients early.\n\nAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)\ngenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to\nthe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full\nmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is\nthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult\ntasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.\n\nHaloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life\nof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow\nrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are\nsensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing\nmore it is hard to comment.\n\nDon Mackie - his opinions\nesiology will disavow..."

If her current physician\nis unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone \nbook for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology, \nor contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society.\nBy finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tune\nwith the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help."

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among \n21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This \nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital \nDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. \n     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been \ncollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center \nfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were \nabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 \nparticipating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \ncesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national \nestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged \nafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from \nnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of \ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \nsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at \nthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value \nof 1.96. \n     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as \nin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean \nrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \nprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. \nIn 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) \nhigher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast \n(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \nthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \ngovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \nhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other \nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \npayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. \n     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women \nincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \nthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, \nessentially the same as the 23.5 observed. \n     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nestimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated \n338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary \ncesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been \nperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean \ndelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, \n35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., \nfailure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal \ndistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. \n     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In \ncomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, \nand for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC \ndeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 \ndays). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for \nprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and \nnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. \n\nReported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center \nfor Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from \n1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates \nhave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that \nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \nchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the \noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). \n     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections \n-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \nthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for \ncesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in \n1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and \n$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \n$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean \nrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number \nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), \nresulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital \ncharges. \n     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may \nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \ndelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women \noffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). \nOf women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) \n--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8).

The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all \nwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was \nattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the \nVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \nrate. \n     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \ndelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review \nprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of \nphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \nawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, \nwhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean \ndelivery (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of \nState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases \namong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the \nhealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 \ncases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June \n1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and \nCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and \nidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This \nreport summarizes the results of the investigation. \n     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were \navailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if \nthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-\nconfirmed as having malaria. \n     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to \nobtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria \nchemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets \nand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long \nsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, \n128 (82%) responded. \n     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in \nKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less \nthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 \nyears (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk \nRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the \ncases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, \ncompared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the \nKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for \nmalaria. \n     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who \nparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine \nalone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were \nnot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly \nlower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 \n9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 \n24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported \nside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. \n     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nall or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely \nused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was \nalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening \n(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; \nupper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with \nfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the \nevening. \n     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel \nthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection \nmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to \nprovide window and door screens for all personnel. \n\nReported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical \nSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, \nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was \nattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased \nmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and \ncontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in \nmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for \nshort-term travelers to such areas. \n     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most \nother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas \n(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In \nAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in \npreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and \nwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk \nfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis \n(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 \nusers 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, \ngastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for \nother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). \n     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need \nfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen \n(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense \nchloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for \npersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil \nis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be \nused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. \nfalciparum has not been reported. \n     Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\non the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are \navailable from Health Information for International Travel, 1992 (i.e., \n\"yellow book\") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and \npertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the \nUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than \n90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these \norganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely \nrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined \nvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate \ninjections. \n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products \nfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for \nvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine \n(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in \nvaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. \n\n                               ActHIB Trademark \n\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), \nmanufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB \nTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This \nvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary \nvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously \nunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months \napart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one \ndose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all \nchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive \na single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving \na primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, \nand 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b \npolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to \nthat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in \nprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early \nbecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nfor use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease \nwere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and \nother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to \nthat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark \n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl \nRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL \nRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis \nBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). \n     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years \nfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when \nindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody \nresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark \nis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, \nand pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other \nDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. \n     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that \nall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-\n15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose \nprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, \n4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A \ncomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and \nTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed. \n\nReported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics \nEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

An international steering committee and scientific \nprogram committee provided guidance. \n     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including \nAsia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United \nStates and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National \nInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, \nand the Procter and Gamble Company. \n     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, \nprofessional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision \nof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and \nmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and \nwomen's issues. \n\n                                Recommendations\n\n     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association \nbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to \nestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for \nmore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology \nstudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral \nlesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. \n\n                                 Epidemiology\n\n     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV \nInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nradically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely \nin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  \nToday, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in \nchildren and adolescents. \n     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a \nmajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  \nFive hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more \nare appearing all the time. \n     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions \nsuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore \nthe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression \nand prognosis. \n\n                            Social/political Issues\n\n     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection \nfocused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for \nindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health \ncare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public \nabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. \n\n                          Saliva and Salivary Glands\n\n     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory \nactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary \nsecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular \nsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid \nsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible \nfor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect \nof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both \npromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) \ndirect effects on the virus or target cells. \n     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease \nin HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. \n\n                               Pediatric Issues\n\n     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With \nearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-\ninfected children has tripled.

It is more than 99 percent \neffective.\n\n\"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent \npregnancy,\" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. \"As an injectable, \ngiven once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to \nmissing a daily dose.\"\n\nDepo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and \nclinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive \nprotection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the \ninjections.\n\nAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and \nrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional \nbefore making a decision to use it.\n\nDepo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive \nstudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies \nin other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo \nProvera effective as an injectable contraceptive.\n\nThe most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In \naddition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, \ndizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have \nacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood \nclots in the legs, lungs or eyes.\n\nThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the \ndrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nRecent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to \nosteoporosis. The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this \npotential effect.\n\nDepo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for \ncontraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., \nwhich will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive \nInjection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. \nAt that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause \nbreast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer, \nincluding breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n       New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses\n                      P92-37 Food and Drug Administration\n                        Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new \nrules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life-\nthreatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. \n\n\"These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious \nillnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would \notherwise be possible,\" said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. \"The effort \nto accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and \nindeed a hallmark of this administration.\" \n\nThese rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to \napprove a drug based on \"surrogate endpoints\" or markers. They apply when the \ndrug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such \nendpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in \nthemselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified \nscientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. \n\nUse of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval \nearlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or \nprevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. \n\nThe new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and \neffectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. \nThe drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct \npostmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate \nendpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. \n\nOne new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a \nmodel of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the \ncause of AIDS. \n\nAccelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that \na drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used \nsafely only under a restricted distribution plan. \n\n\"The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process \nwithout sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight,\" said FDA \ncommissioner David A.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \nvisual impairment \n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \nYancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of \nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \nand for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nresult frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF \ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \nsurgically.\" \n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By \nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). \n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and \nSteinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 19\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease\n\n                          Research Resources Reporter\n                           written by Mary Weideman\n                                 Nov/Dec 1992\n                         National Institutes of Health\n\n\n     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary \nheart disease in native populations of developing countries that have \ntraditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to \ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \ncountries. \n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \nlow in cholesterol and fat.\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\ncholesterol. \n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \ninvestigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol \nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's \"affluent\" diet used in the study \nranks a CSI of 149. \n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects' mean plasma \ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \ndays. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \nof their usual high fat intake. \n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \ndisease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different \ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                             General Announcments\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \ncalling the NCI's Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus \nexpression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this  \nrecombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus \ndoes in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in \npatients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune \nresponses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and \nCD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never \nintended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.

In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-\nantibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific \nactivation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  \nmay contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 \nbinding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added \nsafety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, \nstimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune \nfunction.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was \nchosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first \nphase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith. \n==================================================================    \n\"HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. \n341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline) \n\n     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive \nwomen breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The \nanti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of \nleukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic  \nactivity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to \nbarely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to \ntwelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.  \nBreastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory \nillnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive \nmothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-\n1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than \nbottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower \nprogression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer \nprotection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of \nmilk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA \nantibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against \ncore antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a \nhuman  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and \nmalnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is \nstill the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.  \nTransmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early \nmilk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast \nmilk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  \nmay even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok. \n==================================================================    \n\"Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients\" Journal \nof the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269,  No. 14, P. 1802  \n(Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.) \n\n     If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV  transmission \nfrom dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M.

The \nresearchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and \nattempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients \nwith newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysis \nwas performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the \ndentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the \nmedical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug \nabuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  \nThere were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  \nwere deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients \nidentified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were either \nhomosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the \nremaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was \nreported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence \nof risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single  \nevaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence \nanalysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients \nwere not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV \ntransmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting \nin which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  et \nal. \n       ================================================================   \n                                April 22, 1993 \n       ================================================================   \n\"AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says\" Washington \nPost (04/22/93), P. A13 \n\n     Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes the \nresurging health hazard harder to control, according to a  study published in \ntoday's New England Journal of Medicine.   People who contract TB usually \ndevelop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria \nagain.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight \noff a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes \nMedical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that in \norder to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to \nuse TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB \nbacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County \nHospital  in New York. \n================================================================    \n\"HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. \n341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline) \n\n     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive \nwomen breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's  \nhypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to \nAIDS, \"a hindrance to public health initiatives.\"   However, their hypothesis \nthat HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  \nThe U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, \nno prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this \nhypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  \ndepletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies \nagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals \nfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug-\nAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-\nfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  \nuse altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to \nproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years \nHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same \nAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nproponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS.  \nAlternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs \nfor 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg. \n================================================================   \n\"Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection\" \nLancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.) \n\n     Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases \nin some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infected \nindividuals through the amplification of harmful  \"autoimmune\" reactions, \nwrite Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  \nThe researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with \nhepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  \nprofound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the \nobservation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had \ncirculating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the \nend of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, \ncontained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  \naminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, \nhomologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  \nThese autoantibodies, which also  recognize \"native\" class II molecules and \nmay contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells \"in vivo\", were at low tires \n(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  \nautoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and \nHCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss \nin some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful \n\"autoimmune\" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA \nantigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell \ncounts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very  \nrapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with \nthese HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude. \n       ================================================================   \n                                April 23, 1993 \n       ================================================================    \n\"TB Makes a Comeback\" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6   \n(Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) \n\n     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United \nStates, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, \nminorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at the \nUniversity of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung \nAssociation,  said, \"Right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's  \neveryone's problem.\"  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected \nwith TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their \nimmune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.

State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because \nthose who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with \ntreatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public \nhealth services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic \"because the number of \ncases  is increasing faster than we can treat people,\" said Dr. George  \nDiferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to \nDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of \ndiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City \nresidents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their  \nmedication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more \nexpensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to \ntreat.\n ================================================================    \n \"Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern \nFlorida: Artifact or Reality?\" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. \n83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) \n\n     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in \nsouthern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write \nOkey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  \nThe researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal \nPalm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual \ntransmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, \nor  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route \nof HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records \nfrom social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually \ntransmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor \nwas found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  \nstandardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were \nreviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission \ncategories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the \npercentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties \nbetween January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to \nheterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men \nand from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  \nheterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after \nadjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the \nnational average, the researchers  conclude.\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                                AIDS Statistics\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                            World Health Organization, Geneva\n                        Organisation mondiale de la Sante, Geneve\n\n                              WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD\n                           RELEVE EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE HEBDOMADAIRE\n\n15 January 1993 -

Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\ \n       =================================================================     \n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \n\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \n      ==================================================================\n                                April 20, 1993 \n      ==================================================================\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \n(Kolata, Gina) \n\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We're delighted to see the  \npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \nMaddox. \n      ================================================================== \n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \net al.) \n\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \nconclude. \n      ==================================================================    \n                                April 21, 1993 \n      ==================================================================    \n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \n(04/21/93), P. 7A \n\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \ninfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily \nfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies \nsince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual \nAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, \nled the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come \ntogether, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies \ninvolved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are  \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche, \nEli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck, \nSyntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The \nparticipants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they \nwere aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively  \ninvolved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the \ncollaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong \nscientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nand early clinical data.

Following recent  highly publicized reports of \nhealth professionals who contracted  HIV, the department issued revised \nguidelines on the management  of such cases.  Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief \nMedical Officer, said  doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care \nworkers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV  \ninfection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic HIV testing.

You should\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \n complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)\n you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\n\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\n  \n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\n\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\n \n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\n are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine \n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\n The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'\n  \n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\n \n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \n\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\n \n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\n\n   -- Ron Roth --\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n *   \"Eating Radium has strange results,\"  Tom said brightly.\n---\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363"

However, if exercise\nalso leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally\ndistributed over the entire body.  There is no way to \"spot reduce\" body fat\nother than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is\ngenetically determined.

I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used \n    to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is \n    misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.\n    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug\n    therapy.

All the clamor \nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known \nfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a \nwomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and \nnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\n\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \nwarrented.\n\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \nrestricting calcium intake.\n\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans \nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \ninfections should decline.\n\nMarty B."

I would appreciate any comments about this and other\n'new' technology for hearing aids.\n\nThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and\nappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that\na new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and\nprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of\nthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help\nout in 'noisy' situations.\n\nThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the\nspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),\napparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in\nthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information\n(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are\ntreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have\nalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call\n'abnormal growth of loudness'.\n\nThis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I\nthink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you\nexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit\nbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach\nthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means\nthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high\nend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively\nless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.\nYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially\ndifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially\nfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls\noff a cliff).\n\nAids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low\nand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency\ninformation because of high volume of low frequency components.\nParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech\nand in simulated restaurant noise situations. \n\n-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,\nUSA"

PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most \nphysicians don't recognize it as a specific \"disease\" entity.  Here is \neverything that you would ever want to know about PMS.\n\nPremenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:\n\n\tPMT-A(Anxiety)\t\tPMT-D(depression)\n\tanxiety\t\t\tdepression\n\tirritability\t\tforgetfulness\n\tinsomnia\t\tconfusion\n\tdepression\t\tlethargy\n\n\tPMT-C(Craving)\t\tPMT-H(Hyperhydration)\n\tcraving for sweets\tweight gain\n\tincreased appetite\tbreast congestion and tenderness\n\tsugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness\n\t 1. headache\t\tedema of the face and extremities\n\t 2. palpitations\n\t 3. fatigue or fainting\n \nPMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low \nprogesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle.\n\nPMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple \ncarbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is \nincreased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose \nchallenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are \na low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia \nis not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of \nhypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.\n\tA. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990).\nUnrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium \nsupplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of \nthe total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources \nof alpha linoleic acid.\n\nPMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \nphase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead \ntoxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \nphase). \"Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human \nendometrial cystol\" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).\n\nPMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated \nserum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E \nfor breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H\n\nThis general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:\n\n\tA. \"Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for \n\t    a nutritional approach\". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. \n\t    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.\n\n\tB. \"Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension \n\t    syndromes\", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).\n\n\tC. \"Premenstrual tension\", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)\n\nTreatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can \nfind a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one \nthat will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, \nsupplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really \nhas been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida \nblooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental \ncontrolled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to \nsee done).\n\nHere are a few of these studies:\n\n\tCARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, \"Effect of a low-fat, \n\thigh-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy\" Lancet \n\t2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy \n\tof at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive \n\tspecific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories \n\tand increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary \n\tadvise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant \n\treduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in \n\tthe trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as \n\tphysical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, \n\ttenderness and nodularity.\n\n\tVITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, \"The use of Vitamin A in \n\tpremenstrual tension\" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  \n\t218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU \n\tvitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored \n\tand high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of \n\ttoxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the \n\tstudy was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool \n\tsize(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this \n\tnormal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose \n\tvitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% \n\tgetting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.\n  \t10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS \n\tsymptoms.\n\n\tExperimental Controlled Study, \"Premenstrual tension treated with \n\tvitamin A\" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts \n\treceived 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their \n\tcycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.\n  \tAfter 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in \n\tPMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of \n\ttoxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year \n\tafter high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms \n\tdid not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the \n\tvitamin A supplementation was stopped.\n\nMost Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  \nThese studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal \nstore of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins \ngiven for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best \nsingle effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid \n(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full \nof vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent \nthe symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying \nto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin \nA toxicity.\n\n\tVITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, \"Pyridoxine\n\t(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover \n\ttrial\"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 \n\twith moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.\n  \tAfter 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another \n\t3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of \n\tPMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS \n\twere not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The efects of vitamin B6 \n\tsupplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms\" Obstet. Gynecol \n\t70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received \n\t150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence \n\tshowed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related \n\tto the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as \n\tbehavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)\n  \tAnxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 \n\tsupplementation.\n\nVitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control \npills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  \nWomen on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per \nday.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. \nRubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in \nClin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be \nconsidered the \"first-line\" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the \npatient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin \nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each \nday. \n\n\n\tVITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Efficacy of alpha-\n\ttocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome\" J. Reprod. \n\tMed. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 \n\tcycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a \n\tsignificant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast \n\ttenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant\n \treduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% \n\thad a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo \n\tgroup.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant\n\tdecrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The effect of alpha-tocopherol on \n\tpremenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study\" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. \n\t2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly \n\treceived vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After \n\t2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly \n\timproved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly \n\timprove PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H\n\t(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve \n\tPMT-H symptoms).\n\t\n\tMAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Magnesium prophylaxis \n\tof menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium\" Headache \n\t31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg \n\tdaily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a \n\tplacebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and \n\tcontinued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index \n\twas significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment \n\twas also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual \n\tDistress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  \n\tlymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower \n\tin this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer \n\tfrom PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised \n\tinto the normal range.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Oral Magnesium successfully \n\trelieves premenstrual mood changes\" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). \n\t32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid \n\t360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the \n\tonset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received \n\tmagnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster \n\tpain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the \n\tmagnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were \n\tswitched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on \n\tthe Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by \n\tmagnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium \n\tsupplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes \n\tthat occur during PMS.\n\nThere are numerous observational studies that have been published in the \nmedical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder \nthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But \nsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. \nto be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are \nalso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on \nmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the \nbest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out \nthat PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize \nnutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, \npellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor \nbeing trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS \nis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional \ndisorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.\n\nHere's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral \nsupplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.\n\n\tExperimental Study, \"Effect of a nutritional programme on \n\tpremenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis\", Complement. Med. \n\tRes.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and \n\tsupplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, \n\tmagnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to \n\ttake the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate \n\tdiet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an \n\timprovement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that \n\tthey no longer suffered from PMS. \n\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Role of Nutrition in managing \n\tpremenstrual tension syndromes\", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  \n\tA low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite \n\tsupplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet \n\tchange and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the \n\tvitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased \n\testradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel \n\tphase of their cycle.\n\n\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Clinical and biochemical effects \n\tof nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome\", J. \n\tReprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 \n\ttablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a \n\tsignificant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another\n \tgroup of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this \n\tsecond group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on \n\tPMS symptoms was observed.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 W. 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok 74107\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\""

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung \ndisease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side\n-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also \nbinds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when \nEDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that \nwere not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove \ncalcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C \nand magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra \nvitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium \nfrom the plaques).\n\nThe calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably \ncan be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns \nwith calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.\n\n\t1. \"Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review\"\n\t   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).

L. \nacidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily \nresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of \nthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. \nbulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are \nmuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told \nme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several \ndifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't \ntold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative \nanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a \nchance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria \naround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal \nregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida \nblooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from \nthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do \nbelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower \ncolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the \ncompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.\nRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get \nrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A \nsupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the \ngood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the \npH to basically starve the candida out.\n\n\nMarty B."

Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the \nfrequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the \ncandida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus \nshould be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the \nintestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to \noxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the \nlay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really \namazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.\n\n\nThe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all \nconventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if \nconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard \nmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?\nThe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very \nimportant one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria \nafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason \nto dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply \nand safely(like it is in animal husbandry).\n\nMarty B."

        "content": "Here is a press release from the American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees.\n\n Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other Unions\nCommemorate Workers Memorial Day\n To: National Desk, Labor Writer\n Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State, County\nand Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions\nof the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifth\nannual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6\nmillion workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job.\n   This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an\nthe dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work.\nEarlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, Robert\nVallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections\nfacility in Lucasville, Ohio.\n   The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady\nincrease in the prison population for the past five years.  On\nJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections\nshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an\nexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.\n   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has\ncreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in the\nnumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against\nstaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain\nhigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,\ncompared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.\n   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous\ncombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio\nofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in\nthe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and\nsafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis\nB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.\n   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's\nfederal, state and local correctional facilities.\n   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under\nlife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers\ndie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from\noccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation's\nmost dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:\n\n   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and\n      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are\n      not barricaded or don't have proper lighting.\n   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of\n      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector\n      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more\n      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private\n      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the\n      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care\n      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes\n      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses\n      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety\n      issues facing health care workers include exposure to\n      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high\n      levels of stress.\n   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health\n      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,\n      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man\n      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler\n      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.\n      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the\n      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a\n      growing lack of support services for people who don't have\n      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some\n      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.\n      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.\n      The \"quality\" of the clients is also becoming more violent,\n      as more are moved out of the institutions.\n\n   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards\nsince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.\nMcEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety\nprotections for public employees.\n   \"More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the\njob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA\ncoverage for public employees,\" said McEntee.  \"This, despite the\nfact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,\ncorrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most\ndangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for\npassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater\nrights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees\nsafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.\"\n   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private\nsector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more\nsevere.\n   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed\nin 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states\nhave no OSHA coverage.\n -30-\n--\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\n416-629-7000/629-7044"

Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\notherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional\n\"difficult\" patient.\n\nPoint 2:\n\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\na treatment point-of-view.\n\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\n\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\nfrom them.\n\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\n\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.\nJust my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^)\n\nComments?\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

She said even common ear infections frequently seen in\nchildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.\n\n\"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases\nwould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases\nremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness\nand death in the United States,\" the CDC said.\n\nIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a \"myriad\" of newly\nidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a\ndeadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that\ncauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.\n\n\"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,\nsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,\"\nthe CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been\nundermined by drug resistance.\n\n=====*=====\n\nSOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL\nREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1\nHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues\n\nThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause\ndamage: legal liability.\n\nA federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not\ndoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much\nattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like\nillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in\nrare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners\non notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from\nthe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if\nsomeone becomes infected while on the property.\n\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came\nafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the\nLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the\ndisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered\nthe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than\n$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical\nexpenses and lost wages.\n\nSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or\nsemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the\ngroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.\nKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a\nlegal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential\nliability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard\nbarbecue might be potentially liable.\n\nLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer\nvacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home\nshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky\nMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered\nan outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was\nstung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent\nquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence\nthat a beehive was near the restaurant.\n\nBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the\ncountry -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic\nstates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this\nparticular insect bite a particularly litigious one.\n\nThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the\ncourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will\ncover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not\ndiagnosing the disease.\n\nLawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease\nhave become common in some states in recent years. Payments in\nworker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and\nlost earnings.\n\nThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more\nlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of\nnegligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing\ninjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a\nresult, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property\nowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many\nother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the\ndisease.\n\nIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &\nMaurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help\nto establish \"the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect\nagainst Lyme disease.\"\n\nLawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a\nlawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For\none thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when\nand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs\nin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned\nby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.\nThe workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to\nthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded\nsome work sites.\n\nA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that\nthe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is\nconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding\nthat it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says\nthe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special\npants to protect against bug bites.\n\nDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up\nsome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a\nvictim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.\nEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association\nreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.\nAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical\ndisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.\n\nBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies\nalready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last\nyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &\nCo. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston\nthat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-\nsupply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company\nwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might\nget infected.\n\nRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in\nIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her\norganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole\nKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners\nAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their\n100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing\npesticide.\n\n=====*=====\n\nTITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.\nAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,\nDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson\nUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30\n\nLyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is\nassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients\nwith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.\nUrodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and\ndetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not\nnoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract\nmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding\ndysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may\ndirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the\nLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological\nsymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was\nprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological\ndeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme\ndisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential\ndiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder\nmanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic\nevaluation is recommended.\n\n\nIV. ***** QUESTIONS 'N' ANSWERS *****\n\nNote: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to the\neditor.\n\nSender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.edu>\nSubject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles\n\n  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the\ncompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became\ninfected.\n\n  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to\nback that claim up with documentation.

Make a decision about whether you *really*\nwant to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out\nin the first semester of med school because they found it was\nnot what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four\nyears in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a\ncareer is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be\npushed into it because of your parents/family/significant\nother.  \n\nIf you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you\ncan improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from\na professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive\nrecommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous\nprofessor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't\nbe afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest\nand positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,\nsorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I\nhave turned down writing recommendations for some students\nbecause I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful\ncomments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them\nat that point.  \n\nRewrite your personal statement; take it by an English\nprofessor or some other friendly person with skill and\nexperience in writing and proof-reading and get their\ncriticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you\nsay it.\n\nReview your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor\nin some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further\ncoursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help\nhere.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut\ncourses, it usually shows.\n\nLook at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in\nlocal philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;\nsubstantial leadership roles in an organization help also.\nBeware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to\nspot and weed out.\n\nOverall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why\nyou want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal\nof skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in\napplying to any program, medical or what-have-you.\n\nGood luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting\nis the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)\n\nBob Schmieg"

It is a protozoan that \nlives and multiplies within cells.  In cats, the protozoan multiplies in the\nintestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa can\ncross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic\nafter the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindness\nand mental retardation.\n\nHaving a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnant\nwomen should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.

I applied\nto about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to\nhear from the other school.\n\nLet me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical\nschool admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, \nbut they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, some\nschools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look\nat your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund\non your $50 application fee.\n\nBut, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers\nand are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was it\nan acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was a\ndenial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How\ndid your interviews go?\n\nAs for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted\nme for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was\nover and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection\nletters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are\nstill interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become\nfixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.\n\nWhat do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very\nmediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software\nengineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still,\nI think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted\nis something like this:\n\nVERY IMPORTANT\n--------------\nGPA:\t3.5 or better\nMCAT:   top 15% in all subject\n\nMEDIUM IMPORTANCE\n-----------------\nWriting/Speaking ability\nMaturity\nMotivation for going into medicine\nActivities\n\nLESS IMPORTANT\n--------------\nCollege or University\nMajor\nWork experience\nAnything else you want them to know\n\n\nAnyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in\nmany ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each\nperson as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But getting \nfour interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully, you\nwere able to impress them with your character.\n\n\nGood luck,\nJeff"

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline \nsearch and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since \ncommercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or \nbulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.\nThis is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are \nrecommended rather than yogurt.\n\nI guess the next question is why would this introduction of \"good\" bacteria \nback into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the \nanus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy\ndenys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a \nfacultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and \ncolonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain \nthe reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion \nwas stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the \nintestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida \nlooses it's major food source.\n\nGetting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is \nnormally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal \nyeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has \nbeen used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in \nthe medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting \ntheir own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their \npatients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if \never published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age \nemerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the \nmedical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to \nhelp patients or does it look the other way.\n\nThis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous \ntherapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But \nthere are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty \nhot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only \nwell established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or \ndo it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to \nwork yet?\n\nMy stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they \ninvolve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into \nthe gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other \nis getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a \nproblem with recurring yeast infections.\n\nMarty B."

It's a bit more complicated than\n    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing\n    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited\n    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.

        "content": "Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the\nfollowing two health problems:\n\nFirst, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a\nSchatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it,\nthe hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally\nhave some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki\nring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,\nif I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,\nfood occasionally gets \"stuck\" before reaching my stomach. This results\nin a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.\nFortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,\nand causes frequent discomfort.\n\nMy doctor wants to \"dilate\" the ring using the\nfollowing procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach\nfor any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing\nsome kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know\nif anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,\nwas it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on\nsafety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become\na common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding\nprocedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,\nespecially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,\nreaction to anesthesia).\n\nThe second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number\nof \"extra\" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there\nhas been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24\nhrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this,\nhowever-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist\nindicated that such a number was \"normal\". It certainly doesn't\nfeel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of\nextended \"runs\" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause\nsevere light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good\nhealth (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or\ncaffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as \"normal\", but don't\nwant to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number\nof PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something\nas simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying\ndown for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly\nbe related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the\nsame time.\n\nThanks for any help/advice!\n\n\n===============================================================================\n==============================================================================="

        "content": "Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes.\n\n New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at\nHuntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported\n To: National Desk, Health Writer\n Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or\n          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research\n          Institutes.\n\n   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing \nand measuring chemical imbalances in the brain\nwhich lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been\ndiscovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research\nInstitutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research\nwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,\nRadiology.\n   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ncalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led\nby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly\npatients who were believed to be suffering from some form of\ndementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special\nsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical\nProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses\nin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton\nMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination\ntime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10\nminutes.  By comparison, the current \"standard of care\" in testing\nfor Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and\nneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the\npatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.\n   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\nexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including\nAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's\ndisease.\n   \"We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly\nand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted\nwith either the MRS or PROBE software,\" said Dr. Ross, adding,\n\"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and\nintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease\ncauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.\"\n   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the\nbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker\nin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed\nwith Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their\nlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was\nsignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons\nbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.\n   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely\nconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross\nbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an\ninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\nthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\nyears, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based\non the changing receptors for acetylcholine.\n   \"Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate\nAlzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or\nher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment\nprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we\nconsider this test a major advancement in medicine,\" said Bruce\nMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher\nand a co-author of the study.\n   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,\nPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,\nR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200\nGeneral Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,\nand will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.\n   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology\nMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or\nBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.\n\n   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:\n\n   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?\n   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of\nthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist\nAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\nmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\nloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\n   How many people does it affect?\n   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\nthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\napproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's\ndebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\nemotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the\nmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\nyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\n   What are its signs and symptoms?\n   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\nbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\nof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\nyars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\nto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\nAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\ndeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe \"forgetfulness\"\ncaused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School\nof Medicine at New York University says \"whether forgetfulness is\na serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree\" and\nsuggests the following criteria:\n\n   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is\n      normal.\n   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.\n   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.\n   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.\n\n   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be\nevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms\nof dementia.\n -30-\n--\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\n416-629-7000/629-7044"

I'm\n>trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated.\n>Thanks.\n\nYou've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which\nare used for chemotherapy.\n\nThe overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of\nthese crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy\ncancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different\neffects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than\none drug at a time.\n\nSome chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle\nof a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.\n\nThe first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis\nand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.\nThe third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized \naagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.\n\nThere are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.\nOthers stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.\nAt any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells\nto stop growing.\n\nIf what you are seeking is \"practical\" advice, I apologize for rambling\non the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs\nare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to \nexperience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small\nfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter\nknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines\ntthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications \ncan be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.\n\nProbably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always\nhappen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person \nthemself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different\nside effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug\nheadband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably\nby reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this\ntoo, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.\n\nI highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society.\nThey have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition,\nif your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend \"Reach for Recovery\".\nIt is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast \nbecause of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.\n\nIf you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some good\naccess to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.\n\nI wish the best to you and your friend."

First of all, I would want to know who\n sponsored that study.\n I have seen too many \"nutrition\" bulletins over the years from\n local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the\n bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us\n compliments of the Dairy Industries.\n There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive\n financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous \n benefits of increasing one's calcium intake.\n\n Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved \n in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study\n didn't say that, it only claimed that \"most kidney stones are large-\n ly calcium.\"\n Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact\n opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they\n are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.\n \n Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still \n the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention \n of kidney stones.\n I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in\n one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney\n stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE\n in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium\n type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit\n from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!\n\n     Ron Roth\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n * A stone on the ground is better than a stone in the body.\n---\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363"

There are non-surgical ways,\nhowever, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their\nostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.\nThe underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of\nsinus surgery, though.\n\nAbout asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,\n\"Sinus Survival\", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases\nof asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage\n(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found\nrelief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -\nnot clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.\n\nBefore doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,\nas well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus \nin the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors \nin the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may \nbe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care \nto comment?).\n\nMost stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, \nI don't think that there are many drugs that can help \"dissolve\" the \nkidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium \nhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the \naterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could \nspeed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that \na diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery \nis being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second \nopinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break \nup the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are \nnotorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  \nMy condolences to your friend. \n\nMarty B."

But colonic flushes are not the \nway to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of \nbacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of \nantibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in \nyour gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real \nproblem in some of the outfits that do this \"treatment\" since the equipment \nis not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient \"treatments\".\nDental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've \npicked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his \ninstruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is \nalso used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and \ndisposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than \nthe standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much \nhigher fees do not drive away patients.\n\nI can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to \nthis colonic flush procedure.  For very little, if any benefit, you \nsubject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIV.\nJust ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment?\nCould they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to a \npathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not \ncleaned properly between patients?  Do I really want to take this risk?\nFood for thought.\n\nMarty B."

Since the son is allergic it would be best not to go to\nbottle feedings, but rather eliminate foods from mother's diet.

There \nwill be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph\nbiographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing\nwill then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added\nrichness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may\nalso be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in\nCanada as well.\n \nI am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close \nto being it. Hope to find one soon. \n \nI would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the\npure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of \nthe list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.\n \nI hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian\nScientists, and to discuss what is \"great\" what is \"Canadian\" and what is\n\"scientist\".\n \nPlease respond to:\nshell@sfu.ca\n \nor\nBarry Shell   604-876-5790\n \n4692 Quebec St. Vancouver, B.C.

Once you have read this post, you \nshould know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future.\n\nIn article <123552@netnews.upenn.edu>, lchaplyn@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Lida Chaplynsky) writes:\n> \n> A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on\n> by menopause as well as a mental break down.

Both my wife and I suffered from \nbouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a \nrebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and \nchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through \nher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When \nsevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to \nuse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had \"cured\" her PMS using \nsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet \nin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and \nshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after \nby wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and \none reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another \nstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with \nsupplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. \nI was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using \nB6, niacin, folate and B12 to \"cure\" depression.  I'm not going to do that \nbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.\n\nLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the \nproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use \nan approach which will \"fix\" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly \nwhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be \naffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these \nstressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was \npretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is \na nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your \nbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), \nyou have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any \nnutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from \nbeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase \nyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become \nvery important.\n\nLida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to \ntry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming \nfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic \nMedical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because \nnone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I \npreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by \nmy students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:\n\nIndroduction and Carbohydrates \t\t\tLipids\n\nProteins I\t\t\t\t\tProteins II\n\nEnergy Balance\t\t\t\t\tEvaluation of Nutritional\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStatus I, A Clinical \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPerspective\n\nEvaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional\t\t\nA Biochemical Perspective\t\t\tStatus III, Homework \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAssignment Using the \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNutritionist IV Diet and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness Analysis Software \n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogram\n\nWeight Control\t\t\t\t\tFood Fads and Facts\n\nAge-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements\tFood Additives, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tContaminants and Cancer\n\nDrug-Nutrient Interactions\t\t\tMineral and Water Balance\n\nSodium, Potassium and Chloride\t\t\tCalcium, Magnesium and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhosphorus\n\nIron\t\t\t\t\t\tZinc and Copper\n\nIodine and Fluoride\t\t\t\tOther Trace Minerals\n\nVitamin A\t\t\t\t\tVitamin E\n\nVitamins D and K\t\t\t\tVitamin C\n\nThiamin and Niacin\t\t\t\tRiboflavin and Pyridoxine\n\nPantothenic and Folic acids\t\t\tBiotin and B12\n\nOther Nutrient Factors\t\t\t\tEnteral Nutrition\n\nParenteral Nutrition\n\nEvery three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature \nto find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this \nin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down \nand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books \nthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which \nI write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various \ncopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for \neducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not \nsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).\n\nI am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition \nassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need \nto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the \nnutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to \nbe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to \ndesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment \nCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization with \nhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a \nnutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin \nClinic in California has a similiar lab setup.\n\nFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new \nClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I \nhave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown \nseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more \nto residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition\ntextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it \ndoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a \npatient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the \nPreface of this new text:\n\n\"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, \nhematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge \nof nutrition as it related to their field of practice.\"  \n\n\"Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United \nStates require no formal instruction in nutrition.\"\n\n\"But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the \nleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.\"\n\n\"... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it \nshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of \nnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your \nawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important \nfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially \nevery organ system.\"\n\nRoland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH \n\nLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find \na physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals\n(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and \nwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when \nwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are \noccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A \nnutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned \nthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red \ncell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium \nreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to \ntry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are \nalso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral \nanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using \ncertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some \npretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone \nwho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are \nusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Act).  \n\nA diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown \nto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging \nand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But \nthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not \nshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.\nUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the \nU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional \nprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses \ndiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue \nto be the best approach to depression.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance.\""

        "content": "Hi Stephen\nEar wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing\na barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the\nexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some \nhearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your\nown, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and\nfill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen\nperoxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)\nand insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  \nfirmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the\ntenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl \nunder the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy\na syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever\nyou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try\nadding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up\nthe wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also\nsafe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse\nit out.\nGood Luck\n-heather"

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not \nall calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium-\noxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article \nas a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that \nconventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably \nalways will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that \nyou will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of \ndamage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to \nsinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?).\n\nOn the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical \nchemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of \ncalcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to \nmeasure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the \nserum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good \nnutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue \nreserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see \nhow your technique compares with mine.\n\n\nMarty B."

But before I do, I want to \nget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney \nstone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart \ndisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to \nencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do \nmost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from \nthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to \nbe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.\nSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have \na problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you \nor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.\nHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help \nyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment \nprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When \nmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin \nE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, \nplan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet \nchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.\nBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation \nand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as \nyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a \nregular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her \ngynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even \nscheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for \nthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa).\n\nOne more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses \nhigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is \nabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have \ndrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is \nreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and \nminerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't \nbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a \nlot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new \nClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab \ntests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet \nchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you \nhandle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,\nI'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really \ndon't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think \nthat I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a \nfew with an axe to grind.  That's life.\n\nChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very \nimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor\n(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine \nand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to \nform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,\nand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is \nseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral \nchelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest \nfor all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has \ncome up there several times as a \"fat burner\".  Chromium is among the least \ntoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really \ndo any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for \nchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about \n30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many \nbelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I \ncan cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in \nType II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there \nalso seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is \nbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when \nchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to \nType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and \nglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is \nconcerned\n\nSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, \nthis possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little \nmore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin \nresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity \nis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular \npressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with \nglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. \nNutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt \npeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, \njust about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless \nthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often \nfound in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the \nRBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would \nprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to \ncheck out this possible chromium link to glucoma.\n\nYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC \nchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a \nRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail \nanalysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny \nbusiness going on in these unregulated labs right now.\n\nHere's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider \nchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is \navailable(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they \nalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not \nroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change \nand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?\nMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical \nresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium \nsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of \nCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.\n\nWhat's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight\n(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then \nexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most \nAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have \na poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  \nWhen he or she says, \"what in the world are you talking about\", just say, \nplease get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook \nand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose \ntolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you \nvery much.\n\nMarty B."

While I was a student, I had doctors remove\nrather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple\ntimes, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, and\nsaid something like \"Gee, you've got a lot of wax in there\".  In my case,\nremoval of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, and\nI've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with\nwarm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy little\nbulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store -\nI don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.\n\nOne question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated\na drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining\ntrapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming, too.  It\nworks, but it stings like the devil, so I've always been content to let any\nwater in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get\nout by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.

So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing \nby this \"hated\" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?\nElisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.\nA book that you should be familiar with and not \"hate\". \"Candida species \ncolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly \nthereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \nit.\n\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: \"However, some factors, such as \nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \n\n\n>>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \n>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.

My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the\npossibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in\n1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book\nbecause 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written\nfrom a scientific viewpoint.

Hopefully the right\nclinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In\nthe meantime, I'd still encourage people who have \"incurable\" chronic sinus\nproblems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to\nadminister a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with\nliver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It\nis an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT\nsays \"sorry, you'll just have to live with it\", it is time to step out and\ntry an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence\n(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At\nthis stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and\nhave the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive\nclinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with\nrelatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.

Thperson receivving the scan is gven a\ndose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the\ndistribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given\nintravenously.

        "subject": "Antihistamine for sleep aid",
        "content": "For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful\nwhen I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also\npretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of\nbedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I\nwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because\nI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I\nwent to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.\n\n\tAnyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to\nget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;\nbut he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So\nI used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly\nand felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually\nfelt refreshed the next morning.\n\n\tSo,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and\nexperimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am\npresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The\nantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought\nsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't\nnotice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about\n1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research\nseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest\nsedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic\nform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good\ndosage level to try.\n\n\tFor other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have\nan allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry\neyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did\nguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some\nchanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I\nwent back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)\n\n\tAnyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of\nantihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use\n(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by\nmillions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be\na serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,\nwhereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have\ntried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to\nlower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some\nkind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in\nany other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried\nmany of the non-pharmacological solutions)"

        "content": "Robert,\n\nI'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I've \nbeen compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.\nI didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just \nlike I haven't read \"The Yeast Connection\").\n\nLet me just start by stating that the authors of the \"Cold Fusion\" papers of \nrecent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually \nleft the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a \nreview of the research notes of the \"cold fusion scientists\" actually \nproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.\n\nYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay \ntexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food \ncombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.\nBut some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent \noxidative damage in the body).\n\nYour experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove \nthat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you \nuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees \nI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in \ncommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this \nkind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I \ncouldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really \nguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is \nthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to \nproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so \nthey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. \n\nChemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and \nin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve \nfusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we \nreally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with \nsilicon?  Not in my book Robert.\n\nSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation \nthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon \nbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I \nknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to \nseparate the fiction from the fact.\n\nSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in \nhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing \nthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know \nabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not \nbecause silicon is transformed into calcium).\n\nAlmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective \ntissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show \nthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective \nfactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, \nthe more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity \nwhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as \npart of the ageing process in humans).\n\nFor bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which \ncalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon \nin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the \nbone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.\nElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming \ncells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in \nthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency\n(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of \ndefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also \nanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  \nundetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not \ntransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing \nobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into \ncalcium is an interesting little trick.\n\nBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and \nyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without \na very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group \nare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any \nbetter).\n\nIf the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, \nI'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources \nthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems \nto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm \ngoing to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us \nkindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.\n\nFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's \ninteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric \nneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his \nname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in \nour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with \nbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses\"unconventional\"\ntreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one \ncase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional \ntreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the \ncost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between \nradiation treatment and surgery is guys? \n\nI'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the \nchronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)\nand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which \ndo not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it \nbecause candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?\nHow about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your \nsinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).\n\nMarty B."

There is also water retention (possibly around heart),\nchanges in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things.\n\nI am not a doctor, so I'm sure I mistated something, but the important\nthing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they\naren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body.

        "subject": "Vitamin A and Infection",
        "content": "I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to \nposting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to \ndelete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send \nit back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.\nSince digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all \nday for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has \nthem).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and \nMorgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to \npoint out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical \ncommunity.\n\nDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long \ntime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've \nalready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.\nNow I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in \nthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).\n\nWhen vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as \nthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have \ndecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C\n(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is \nalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).\nThe NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if \nvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in \nboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).\n\nVitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and \nbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene \nis the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-\ncarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present\n(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other \ntissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human \nadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We \nare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about \n30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they \nwere born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that \nof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is \nnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient \nreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of \nvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet \nsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A\n(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National \nResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the \nRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to \n7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was \nkilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main \nreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient \nreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to \nmove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move \ntowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have \nsome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely \nimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that \nbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the \n1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the \ndietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the \n1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill \nthe reserves).\n\nWe know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a \nnormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient \nreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.\nBut for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how \nmuch somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has \noverfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol \nlevel(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your \nliver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal \nrange of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is \ndiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation \nof Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level \nof vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to \nvitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative \napproach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in \nthis post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty \nof warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, \nredness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).\n\nI tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they \nhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear \nsigns that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient \nneeds the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you \nwill always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for \nPMS studies).\n\nBeta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will \nnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to \nretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the \nliver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But \ntaking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to \nfill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% \nthat only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One \nother problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not \nconvert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the \nenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of \nretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will \ncause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.\n\nNow what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body \nuses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be \nnailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde\n(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the \nretinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses \nretinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells \nand the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, \none of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the \ntitle of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play \na role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role \nis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake \nof vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But \nretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once \nit's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC \ngroup wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.\n\nMost people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are \nhelping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and \nthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do \nthemselves more harm than good.\n\nRetinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.\nIn the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus \nproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from \nentering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the \"first \nline\" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown \nto act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which \nstimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration \nand cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters \nare not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not \nnormally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.\nThis is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials \nin progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.\n\nChronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that \nvitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who \nwalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be \nworked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already \nhas on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my \ncourse at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic \nmedical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.\n\nDark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night \nvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The \nserum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver \nreserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have \ntrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled \nout).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels \nwere measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below \n20ug/dl.\n\nAs more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of \nthe U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably \nsee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low \nserum retinol levels.\n\nWhat do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts\nfrom their book:\n\nVitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for \ngrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for \nreproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie \nmalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and \nmetabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, \nwhich has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not \nin reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A \nstatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal \nrange for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are \nindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater \nthan 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation \ntests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to \nperform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to \nvitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The \nbronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal \ntract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than \n7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts \nover 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, \nerythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois\n(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  \n\nThey recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A \ndeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol \nlevel is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in \nadults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule \nout a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical \nlab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give \nthem the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity \nshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the \npatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.\n\nBoth Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.\nRecall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.\nI don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to \nfill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the \nserum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the \nvitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a \ndemonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will \nprovide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status \nare good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more \nagressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But \nvitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could \nbecome pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human \nfetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is \n18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on \nthe human fetus.\n\nCould just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes \nbut the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use \nretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it \nfull.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to \nprescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup \njumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A \nsupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I \nthink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market \nbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general \npublic about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.\n\nMarty B."

Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions,\nrelaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as\nthose with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.\n\nAntihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom)\nare potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.

A regular\neveryday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the\nbody at all.\n\nThe pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)\non the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 -\none is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in\nthe liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other\nhormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the\nbody's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but\nthe liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in\nshort order.\n\nGood sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's\nreference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)\nand the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local\nlibrary).\n\nI hope this has been of some help.\n\n-Eileen Bauer"

But it can be the decisive component\nof an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an\nimportant contribution to good health.  It is important to\nexercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).\n\nChromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase\nlean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the\nstatistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.\n\nChromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of\nthe essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role\nin \"sensitizing\" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.\nWeight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity\nto insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose\nweight (4).\n\nInsulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards\nprotein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This \"protein sparing\"\neffect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets\nas insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle\nand organ tissue.  By \"sensitizing\" muscle to insulin,\nchromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters\nso that they \"burn\" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation\nof lean body mass has an important long-term positive\neffect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the\nfat they've lost.\n\nChromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding\nthe thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.\nInsulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability\nof food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin \nstimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say\nthat chromium picolinate increases metabolism.\n\nIn summary, you need to change your life style in order to\nloose weight and stay healthy:\n\n  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.\n     - Eating fat makes you fat.\n\n  B. Increase dietary fiber\n     - low in calories; high in nutrients.\n\n  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week\n     - burn calories.\n\n  D. Take chromium picolinate daily\n     - lose fat; keep muscle\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater\ncan cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are\npotentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall\ncorrectly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses\ninvolves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which\nis a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with\nsulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic\nglutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts\nattacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic\nnecrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the\ndelay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver\ndamage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.\n\nAs to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams\nof acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably\ncause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.\n\nBob Schmieg"

None of his A-1 through A-5\nantineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against\nexperimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against\nleukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce\ntoxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth\nof the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)\n\nBurzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1\nand A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been\nextracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually\ndistinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10\nagainst a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines\nfrom tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and\nsmall-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous\nsystem, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited\nneither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.\n\nIt is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's\ntheory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to\nPAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying\npeptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for\nantineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1\nmixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a\nchemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically\nextremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are\nhabit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects\nof thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10\ndoes not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce\nteratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.\n\nMany of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early\nresearch, past and present support by others for his work have been\nshown to be untrue.\n\n\nsdb\n---\nsdb@ssr.com"

See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).\n\nYou can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the\nClassic Example, but there are probably others.\n\nIridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By\nlooking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises\nyou are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.\n\nThe two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:\n\n1: How does it work?\n\n2: What evidence is there?\n\nThe answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to\nevaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on\nreflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the\norgans of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are\nsupposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or\nenergy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.\n(Always beware the words \"channel\" and \"energy\" in any spiel put out\nby an alternative practitioner.)\n\nThe answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is\nanecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in\nmainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of\nrich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done\nand papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.\n\nThe word \"licensed\" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by\nwhom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and\nrequires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong\nplants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove\nand Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license\nextends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be\ntold that it means \"(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist\".\n\nBTW, the usual term is \"herbalist\".

Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,\nbiochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic\npersistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular\ncarcinoma.\n\nMost cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of\na viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be\ndetermined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It\nconsists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting\nplate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast\nto chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, \nbridging necrosis, or fibrosis. \n\nCPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and\nCPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed\nout, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have\nit. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing\nareas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe\nit is a continuum.

Med. on the \ntopic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a \nvery refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving \nthat manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in \npointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better \nprogress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their \ntechingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation \nto relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or \nbetter than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not just \nthe woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA \neditors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove \nitself to the medical community.\n\nI'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which \nhas supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support \nnutrition education and research.  I've pointed out, in a grant proposal, \nthat the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and \nmanipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing \nonly drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs \nduring his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a \nbetter way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being \nworse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body, \nhe developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his \nstudents in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17.\nStill used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he \nused diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic \nProfession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to \nspeak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little \nunderstanding of how diet affects human health.

Some studies suggest \nthat early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial \nbecause exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and \nmortality(mumps, measles. etc.).\n\n> -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?\n> How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

But many viruses \nmutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(\nnew antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline \nwith time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.\nChronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression \nbut this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.\n\n> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\n> term effects?\n\nYes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good \nbacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects \nof this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the \nmedical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects \nof chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).\n \n> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\n> normal, and what does one do about it?\n\nChronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my \nopinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is \nnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many \ninfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some \nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \nassociated with the infection.\n\n> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\n\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also \nbe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a \nnutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(\nlike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.\nMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's \nwhat you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves \nnutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training \nneeded to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good \nfor getting general dietary advice from however.\n\n> Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much\n> appreciated.

Cold virus mutate easily.\nHowever, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these\ndiseases, so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold,\nwe make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp \nat night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net).\nThat's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her\noff antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would\nhave antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she\nfought the illness off.  I do understand that you don't have much choice if\nthe child is in pain and/or high fever. \n\n>does it make kids \"weaker\" (leading to more illness later), or does it\n>not have any long term effect?\n\nIf the child doesn't rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime,\nthen the child should be stronger.\n\n>\n>-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\n>term effects?\n> \nI'll leave this to expert.\n\n>-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\n>normal, and what does one do about it?\n>\nIf your child just entered daycare, I'm pretty sure the first 6 months will be\nthe hardest.

My doctor started using one recently, and I\nthought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  \n\nThe thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.\nThe ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point\nthe thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear\nto straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then\npushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.\nIt is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on \nyourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,\nand may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  \n\nI talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,\nand she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give\nme some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion\nfeels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly\non one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to\nthe company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company\nhad told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end\nof the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior\nto reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree\nof the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.\n\nI have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the\nprobe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you\nhave to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button\nto get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect\nthat many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for\nyet another reason.\n\nIn short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe\nit doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature."
