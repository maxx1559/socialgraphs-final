All homicides must be shown, per capita, not  \n: just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  \n: murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  \n: favorite.\n\nAs a \"favorite\", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in\nChicago produced this table:\n\n\t\tPercentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks\n\t\t\t    Resulting in Death\n\t\t\t    \n\tWeapon\t\t\t\tDeaths As Percentage of Attacks\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------\n\tKnives (16,518 total attacks)\t\t 2.4\n\tGuns (6,350 total attacks)\t\t12.2\n\n\tSource: Firearms and Violence in American Life\n\t\nIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns\nthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\n\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\n\n\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\n\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\n\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\ndon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\n\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\n\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\n\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\nstandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.\n\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\n\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\n\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\nin Vancouver.\n\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\nearlier findings.\n\n-------\n\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\ninterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\n\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\nSeattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\nself-defense.\n\n\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\n\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\n\n\tJohn H.

        "content": "----------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpen letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for\nNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear sir:\n\nBy now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication\nof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are\ndrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of \nmomentus \"scientific\" findings. These are regularly released to the press\nwithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and\noften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.\nGenerally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however\nmeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle\nserious studies by criminologists.\n\nThe latest effort -- \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:\nA Tale of Two Cities,\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying \neditorial, \"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\" by two employees\nof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult\nto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few\ndata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length\nto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular\norder.\n\n\t1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to \n\tsupport the statement that \"some have argued that restricting\n\taccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate\n\tof homicide.\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that\n\tcontention.\n\t\n\t2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very\n\tsimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,\n\tdemographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities\n\tare very different with very different demographic characteristics\n\twhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in\n\tSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white\n\tand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be\n\tthe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-\n\tgrounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various\n\tethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.\n\t\n\t3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,\n\tcompared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all\n\tthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect\n\tin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-\n\t1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth\n\tinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM\n\tarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving\n\thandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that\n\tone must look to see the prior situation was before concluding\n\tthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that\n\ta patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day\n\tfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without\n\tat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?\n\t\n\t4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national\n\tgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily\n\tselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because\n\tit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific\n\treason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which\n\tinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \"control\"?\n\tHad different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite\n\t\"scientific\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide\n\trate *exceeds* that of such \"wild west\" cities in Texas as\n\tEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado\n\tSprings. (Ref. 3)\n\t\n\t5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or\n\thandguns \"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in\n\tVancouver.\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending\n\tto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is\n\tan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry\n\tpermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in\n\tVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of\n\thandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun\n\towners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number\n\tof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns\n\tfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns\n\tlegally for protection, registration figures are\n\tmeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York\n\tCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,\n\tthat method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population\n\tin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver\n\thas a greater \"prevalence of weapons\" than New York City.\n\t\n\tThe second method of measuring gun density is \"Cook's gun\n\tprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity\n\tdifferences.\" But the validation was by Cook of his own\n\ttheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a\n\tdifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is\n\tbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement\n\tin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking\n\ta measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide\n\t(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in\n\thomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in\n\tVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-\n\tability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and\n\tVancouver.\n\t\n\t6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and\n\tCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that\n\tWashington has a waiting period and background check prior to\n\tthe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian\n\tlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personal\n\tprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is more\n\tdifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually\n\tthe case.\n\t\n\t7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain\n\tthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the\n\tpenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of \n\tclearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a\n\tfirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number\n\tof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making\n\tarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest\n\trates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences\n\timposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,\n\tor gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social\n\tscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,\n\tthe authors of the NEJM \"tale of two cities\" fail even to mention\n\tmost factors related to crime control.\n\t\n\t8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective\n\tmeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not\n\tthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost\n\t650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from\n\tcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the\n\tliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be\n\tcompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury\n\tto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors\n\treported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides\n\twithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle\n\taccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides\n\tinvolving firearms.\n\t\n\t9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \"study,\"\n\teditorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \"applied\n\tscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb\n\tadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly\n\thandguns.\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly\n\tbe mistaken for \"scientific methods\" by a sociologists or\n\tcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \"study\" is the equivolent\n\tof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding\n\ttwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25\n\tand the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,\n\tadministering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while\n\tgiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure\n\tand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, \n\tannouncing in a \"special article\" a new medical breakthrough.\n\tIt would be nice to think that such a \"study\" would neither be\n\tfunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.\n\t\n\tSince the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC\n\tmake them willing to present shoddy research as \"scientific\n\tbreakthroughs\" in \"special articles\" and editorials relating\n\tto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying\n\tthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversight\n\tover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about\n\tthe distortions contained in \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,\n\tand Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"Firearm Injuries: A Call\n\tfor Science.\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside\n\twhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize\n\tan opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tREFERENCES\n\n1.

Wright\n          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)\n\n      Someone once wrote: \"Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is\n   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\"  The problem is demonstrated\n   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting\n   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by\n   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal\n   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and\n   suggested that a handgun ban \"may reduce the rate of homicide in a \n   community.\"\n      The nine medical doctors who published \"Handgun Regulations, Crime,\n   Assaults, and Homicide\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite\n   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver\n   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations\n   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems\n   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period\n   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.\n   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,\n   Why?\n      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case\n   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,\n   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their\n   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and \n   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point\n   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support\n   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody\n   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We\n   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that\n   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates\n   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.\n      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two\n   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-\n   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons\n   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the\n   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.\n*     The second bit of evidence is \"Cook's gun prevalence index,\" which stands\n*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index\n*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in \n*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage\n*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.\n*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,\n*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take\n*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be\n*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides\n*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general \n*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To\n*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \"prove\" it on the basis of\n*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.\n      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that\n   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.\n   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun\n   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates\n   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,\n   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.\n      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of\n   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the \n   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin \n   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime\n   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke\n   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.\n      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data\n   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \"similar in\n   many ways,\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law\n   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish\n   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \"all\n   else is equal\" among things being compared.\n*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look \n*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime\n*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage\n*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle\n*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.\n*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the\n*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-\n*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown\n*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.\n*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is\n*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates\n*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide\n*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.\n*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due\n*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,\n*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics\n*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison\n*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial\n*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle\n*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain\n*  in either city.\n      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the\n   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority \n   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \"gun availability\"\n   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not\n   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why\n   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed\n   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,\n   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)\n      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between\n   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have \n   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol \n   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city\n   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the \n   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the\n   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian\n   percentage?\n      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many\n   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent\n   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \"many ways\" might explain part\n   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such\n   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.\n*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide\n*  result in a \"complex picture.\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing\n*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They\n*  also acknowledge that \"socio-economic status is probably an important\n*  confounding factor in our comparison,\" remarking further that \"blacks   \n*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of\n*  Vancouver's population.\"  Given the evidence presented in the article,\n*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle\n*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial\n*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,\n*  since \"detailed information about household incomes according to race\n*  is not available for Vancouver.\"\n      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in \n   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple\n   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms\n   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one \n   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.\n   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce \n   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into\n   account?  In this example, the \"hidden variable\" is city size: Guns are\n   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city\n   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the\n   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very\n   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities\n   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,\n   and their results are impossible to interpret.\n      In the editorial \"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\" accompanying\n   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the\n   authors for applying \"scientific methods\" to a problem of grave public\n   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from\n   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate\n   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them\n   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are\n   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this\n   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical\n   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--\n   is cause for further concern.\n\n   [James D.

I would even \nsuggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the\ncontext of his political agenda.

There were 21 cases of civilians killing their \nattacker in self-defence.

Most other \nstudies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.\nThose figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences\ninvolve killing the attacker.) \n\nSo, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) \ncases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted\nin the death of the attacker.

Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the\nthreat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger\nusing a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim \nin an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not\nbe as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually\n_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)\nIt isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a\nknife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more\ncommon. That's why it is important to look at the overall\n(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of\nsubstitution, different criminal techinques of using different\nweapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.\n\n>As for knives, see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife\n>than a gun, thanks.  \n\n\"Face\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't\ntoo common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the\nusual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts\nto much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your\npockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun\nthan actually stabbed with a knife.\n\n>...Fortunately, the best defense against a knife isn't\n>another knife.  Anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have\n>much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife\n>assault (which probably means 99.9% of knife assailants).\n\nActually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in\nunarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman \nwithout much problem.\n\nYou also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime\nSurvey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a\nknife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives\nin a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost\nall prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,\nusing (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)\na weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless\nof how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective\nthan guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a \"serious threat\"\nnearly as often as they do guns.\n\n                                              Frank Crary\n                                              CU Boulder"

But\nthere would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to \nconsider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with \nfireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000\n(National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes\neach year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find\nthe number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are\nhomicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately\n5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides\nand fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to \nbe any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures\nwould disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns.\nThat would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF,\nonly 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since\ngun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal\nsales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,\nlaw-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on\narmed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) \nThat doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.\n  \n>...There were over 250 >accidental< handgun\n>homicides in America in 1990, most with licensed weapons.\n\nSince most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not\nsupporting \"reasonable\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background\nchecks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would \nalter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you\nare supporting.\n\nBy the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.\n250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to \nother household accidents.\n\n>...More\n>American children accidentally shot other children last year (15)\n>than all the handgun homicides in Great Britain.\n\n1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from \ndrinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from\nfalls.

According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal\nmanufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and\nsubmachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the\npolice and military being the other two.)

Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing\naround on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to \npay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's\ntime for something legal would run about $100.

It's homicide rate is almost ten\ntimes the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.\nresident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and\nbuy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs\nand make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban \ncan not be easily side-stepped.\n\n> >To show why the tools argument is the silliest i have ever seen.. take an\n> >analogy from computer science... almost every computer science major\n> >can write a \"wordprocessor\" yet we(comp sci majors)  would willingly pay 3  \n> >to 400 bucks for a professional software like wordperfect... why don't we  \n> >just all write our own software???......

More likely,\nyou would find a friend who was a particularly good programer\nand get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad\nexample for your case: How many people do you know with illegal\ncopies of $400 word processors?

The formula has been around for half a million years.\nOr are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and\nsaltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but\nit works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction\nin energy (so a .357 magnum would \"only\" be as deadly as a 9mm)\nand it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer\ncould just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the\npolice (the police are often corruptable, and things are known\nto disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and\nreappear on the streets...)\n\n> > If guns were really that simple to make... the Bosnian muslims would\n> >be very happy people (or is it the case that metalworking tools are\n> >banned in bosnia???

What do you think 75% of you is?\n\nBut whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the\nneutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water\nturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would \nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\n\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\nis clearly appropriate.\n\n>>  Plus these things have no self-\n>>defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as\n>>a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use\n>>(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration\n>>(translation:  cities and population centers).\n\n>\tIf the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal\n>government, they are indeed useful weapons to the militia.\n\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\nfor that.\n\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\n\n                                                  Frank Crary\n                                                  CU Boulder"

When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  \n\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll \nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \nwith your note.  \n\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn't \nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \n\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn't \nsupport the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions \nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \n\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \n\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \nclearly indicate the contrary.  \n\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \n\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \ncriminal offense.  \n\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \nwouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's \npermission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \nBefore the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \nineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in \nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \nand their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\n\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \naware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what \ntheir real motives are.  \n\nLook:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \nit's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\n\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \nprovides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I \nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \n-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can \nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \n\nSo what's the point?  \n\nL.

        "content": "I wrote :\n  Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were\ntanks\n  used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired\ntheir\n  main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is\n  ludicrous.\n\nAwesley replied:\n     I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,\n  supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.\n\nThe issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It\nhas been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that\ntanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\nsniper fire and that they were \"quite\" effective at this.  You continue to\nback away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\ndisputing.\n\nAwesley went on:\n  I\n  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was\n  down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10\n  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's\n  Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of\n  Tonia Blanding, age 4.\n   \n        \"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction\n  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the\n  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front\n  of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out\n  of the side of the apartment.\"\n  \n       Well, it's not the main gun.  \n\n\"Well, it's not the main gun.\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\nnow going to admit that you were wrong?\n\nI wrote:\n  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main\n  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I\nread\n  the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. \n  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard\n  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American\n  cities in the Sixties.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to\n  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main\n  guns.\n\nI will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\nriots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\nwithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\nmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\nbeen *big* news.\n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nTo fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\ngrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\nperfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\nit makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nAnd on:\n  I don't\n  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and\nactually\n  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know\n  what you find.\n\nI already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used\nF-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you\nbelieve me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research\nit?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?\n\nIf tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\nscreaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\nit.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \nIf your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\nto live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\nthose tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\n--John L. Scott"

The University cops here (who are\n>are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most\n>state cops are.\n\nDefine \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\n\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\n\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\n  the trigger again.\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n  to rotate to the next round.\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n  easy motion, even one handed.\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it's jammed!\" before starting to do anything\n  about clearing it.\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\n  of employment as a revolver.\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\nas the timer on a VCR.\n\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\nthe police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\n\nGun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a \nwonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.\nGood controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.\nI own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon\nto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit\nwhat I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously\nwrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those\nextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in\ncriminal encounters is less than 5.\n\nWhat do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple\n.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police \nprefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....\n\nObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they \n        introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking\n        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.\n\n-- \n\"If everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect.\"\n\t-BATF spokesperson on CNN 3/2/93, regarding failed raid attempt in TX."

The time scale\nand the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a\nbasic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.\nIn America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal\nliberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but\nI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict\nindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd\nhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and\npersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would\nhave sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture\nwe have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy\nto identify with only a small segment of the population.

I never said that these\n\talternative means of self-protection involved any hardware.\n\tWhy are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because every\n\tperson is armed to the teeth. It is because of (1) attitude\n\tand (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents\n\tmake themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when\n\tstrangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups\n\tlike 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative\n\teffectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the\n\tgood neighbors step up and say \"THAT'S the one officer ! He\n\twas robbing Mr. Jones' house\". \n\n\tIn short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at\n\tleast a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.\n\tReplace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better\n\tconversationalist too and you can invite it over for a\n\tblock party. \n\n>>> Freedoms and rights are not dependent on public opinion, necessity, or\n>>> scientific scrutiny.\n>>\n>>\tNew to this planet ?

Every\n|day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming in.  The majority that I\n|see are still carrying revolvers.  Not that there is anything wrong with a\n|revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple\n|of automatics in his coat (I mean semi-auto handguns) you're going to be at a\n|disadvantage even with training.  I have been at a shooting range where gang\n|gang members were \"practicing\" shooting.  They were actually practicing\n|taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target\n|and they weren't doing too badly either.   The University cops here (who are\n|are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most\n|state cops are.  I don't know where you are originally from David but you live\n|in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news\n|and in the papers.  I think the situation is just a tad different here\n|than there.\n\nHowever, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about\nanything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for\ncarry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka,\nwho happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun\npolice chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).\n\nPerhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to-\n100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable\nautomatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto\nhandgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.\n\nI don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make\non the order of at least $40K/year. \n\nYour presumption of \"disadvantage\" I think is not borne out by the\nexperiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out\non top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.\n\nI've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers\ncarried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; others\nhave seen Browning Hi-Powers...\n\n|Jason"

You still haven't offered\n\nI've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I'd rather face a knife than\na gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\nsame thing, then I got 'educated.'\n\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\n(within a minute or so) death.\n\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\n'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\nonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\n\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\nability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\nstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\nslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\nthe attacker.\n\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\nknife attacks in prison.\n\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\ncast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike\nin 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\nseconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\npointed end.)\n\nAdd to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\nseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'\n\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\n\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\nattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\ncaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually\ndo this.\n\nRemember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\n'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\nus alive.\n\nI don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now\nknow, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would\nhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I\nWOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not\nfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen\nbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do\nwhatever it takes.\n\nRick."

Sure there is\n>that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety.\n\nYou're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be\ndepressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned\nthing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just\nabout (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is\nfunctioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working\ncorrectly is totally drop safe.\n\nNow, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single\ndocumented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because\nhe failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few\ndocumented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't\nfigure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the\nproprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely\nprevented the office from getting shot.\n\nThe purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.\nThis does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down\nintentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a\n'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the\nstandpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.\nBy this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.\nFrom the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a\nrevolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of\nfiring it.\n\nThe ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that\nthe firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the\nwide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be\nfamiliar with that particular type of firearm.\n\nRick."

The 80 series Colt's for\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\n\n> - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n>   operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nAgreed.\n\nNow that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On\nthe other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\nyears.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\n\nI've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\n\nMost revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\ninto that category.\n\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \"The Semi\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\n\nIn general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\n\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\nisn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.\n\nFor myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\n\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\ntoo!)\n\nIf this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)\n\nRick."

Somewhere between 1 out of three and \none out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent \nassault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems\nlike heart attack and stroke.\n\n'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans\nusing firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some\nmay have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in \nusing firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.\n(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, \nbut many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage\nif anything is low.)\n\nAt any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred \nto as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group \ncan be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might \nsupport a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.\n\nCertainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half\nof your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.  \n\n>\t                               Besides, there are other\n>\tmeans of self-protection which can be just as effective\n>\tas firearms. \n\nPlease provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might \nconvince your local police departments to switch.  Good luck.\n\nRick."

I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.\n\n>Guns 'n Criminals:\n>MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.\n\n       This is very likely.\n\n>Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.\n>And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),\n>we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.\n\n       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many\npeople would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\nheavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.\n\n>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:\n>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!\n\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide\nrates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\nhalf the per-car death rate.\n\n>The issue (I hope..):\n>I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.\n>Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is....

The\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\nirrelevent.\n\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\n\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\n\n>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them\n>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,\n>it's the 'axer' ??\n>(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)\n\n\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got\nmore knives or fists.  \n\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\nare doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is \nviolent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\nyou can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\n\n>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect\n>themselves. Is this a good situation ?? \n\n       The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives.\nBut recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,\nprotecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,\ntoo, lost their livelihoods?\n\n>Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??\n\n       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.\nHowever, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can\nbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\nwon't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\n\n       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If\nyou're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\nsimply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\n\n>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have\n>guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)\n\n       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.\nThat accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.\nFirearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the\ngroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.\n\n       You may take that for what it's worth.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \"snipers\"\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\n\nI don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\nIts the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\ngovernment going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\n\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\ngunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".  I think it could be\ndone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is\nnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning\nand firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible\nto cover up.\n\n>--John L.

        "content": "Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\n\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.\n\nFriday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.\n\nSynopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent\nCooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald\nHowen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\n\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\nthe government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\"\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \"If\nyou're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I'm not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals.\"\n\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we'll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \nSpence continued, \"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can't have a fair trial if the\njury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm\nviolating court orders.\"\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\n\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled\nis the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton."

        "content": "Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about\nthe Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).\n\n1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?\n     What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're \"in committee\".\n     How close is that to being made law?\n\n2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important\n   differences I missed?\n\n3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:\n  A. S414 doesn't specify an \"appeals\" process to wrongful denial during\n     the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals\n     process once the required instant background check system is established,\n     but not before).\n  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving\n     using existing records (so who would I sue in \"A\" above to have an\n     inaccurate record corrected?)\n  C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person\n     can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an\n     immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.\n     But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a \"threat\", nor does\n     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception\n     statement.\nTrue?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?\n\n4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a \"clean\" record from\n   buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?\n   At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?\n\n   'Seems at min. a \"gun counting\" scheme would be needed\n   (e.g., \"John Doe owns N guns\").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised\n   to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun\n   registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.\n\nPlease comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current\nlegislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits\nof any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.\n\n\tMarkS || shepard@netcom.com"

Find another way.\n\nYou know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straighten\nthings out in this country.  Also, people would have a need to replace\nguns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OC\nseem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal.\n\nGuns are really \"old\" in design and as long as we have tons of them, no one\nis motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up with\nsome real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would get\nus moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want, right?  Stuff\nthat's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.\n\nRemember, in this country we'll really scramble to accomplish impossible\nfeats if we are motivated enough and I think \"self-defense\" is high on our\nlist of motivators."

It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get\n   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I\n   was told by a police officer.\n2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to\n   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns\n   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.\n3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will\n   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.\n   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form\n   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  \n   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these\n   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will\n   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess\n   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.\n4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will\n   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations\n   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some \n   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.\n   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)\n\nThis covers most of what we discussed.

Most of my friends\nare anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions\non facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the\ncontrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world\nmore civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They \nwould rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how\nsociety has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They \nsupport spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum\nwho have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society\nor its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun\ncontrol (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun\ncontrol (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they\nhave to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront\nthe fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that\nare causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't\naccept that!

Alas, this is not provable. I think that that\n> there are actually *few* cases where this is so. \n\nexcerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago:\n\n     Although less apparent to those who have not researched\nthe facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  as\nsport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recent\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\npolice.\"2\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\nrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,\nthe completion rate drops to 3%.\n \n1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine\nde Gruyter, NY, 1991\n2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A\nSurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,\n1986\n-------\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

(I can't speak\nauthoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they\nstarted running a \"Two Million Strong!\" campaign for a while -- but they\nlet it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they\nsimply were never going to reach that level of membership.\n\nIn 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting\npoint of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.  \nBy 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had \nabout a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the\nthird largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA).\nAnd its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical\nfigures from Kukla's \"Gun Control,\" pp. 61 and 420.)\n\nAs you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused\nby their T-bones and MTV.

It seems most\n|> >state cops are.\n\nEvery city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the\nlast two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though\nI haven't seen any Glock's). \n\nWith regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual\nrantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two\ncents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a \nlarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to\nsemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand\nhim and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is\nvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something \nlike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that\n\"different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in \nmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a\ncertain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to \nlearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar\nwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least\nslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.\n\n|> \n|> Define \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\n|> Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\n|> faster rate of fire is usually not desirable.

With a single hand you either\npull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi\nauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.\n\n\n|> - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n|>   to rotate to the next round.\n\nI'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA\nsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same\nround - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will\nalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud\nbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will\nnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide\non a misfire takes very little time.\n\n\n|> - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n|>   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n|>   easy motion, even one handed.\n\nActually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not\nnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and\nat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the\nround to set it off.\n\n|> - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n|>   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\nThe best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed\nloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two\nhanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that\nwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the\ngun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always \ntake more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing\na partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can\nstill be used if needed later).  \n\n|> \n|> - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n|>   first, time spent which can be fatal.

Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire\nwith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto\nbut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).\n\n\n|> - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n|>   and cock the hammer.

While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should\nsay that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's\nno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing\npin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage\ncarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed\nof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm\nnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was\ninitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining\nthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and \nshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in\na thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets\nyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.\n\n|> \n|> Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\n|> switching many officers back to the old revolvers.

I imagine that if all\nyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger\nfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that\nnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and\nrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew\noff your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.\n\n|> \n|> Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\n|> the police don't know nothing about firearms.

And they are fired\nfrom something that looks like a tear gas launcher.\n\nThere are smaller rubber bullets and pellets (for shotguns).  I understand that\nthey are only intended to be discouragers, ie. for the snapping but not truly\ndangerous animal.  In general, they do not seem capable of really stopping\nsomeone who wants you or past you.  They are fired at very low muzzle velocity\n(the .38 ball round is intended for a 400fps load).

I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends.\nBasically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to\nlearn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was\nlooking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the\nsafties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot\nmore \"safe\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course\nthis could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You\nwould spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.

I would prefer more training with\na \"traditional\" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.\n\nJason"

It\n: has been whether they fired their main guns.  \n\nNever?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort\nto falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.\n\nAt the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was\nthe chain was regarding the tanks \"last used in Detroit in 48\".\nThe text follows.\n\n:  You did not merely claim that\n: tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\n: sniper fire and that they were \"quite\" effective at this.  \n\nIndeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say\nI had been told they did fire their main guns.  \n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n: You continue to\n: back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\n: disputing.\n\nWell, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks\npost-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  \n\n: \"Well, it's not the main gun.\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\n: now going to admit that you were wrong?\n\nThat was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?\n   --------------------------------------------------\n  \"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\nto respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"\n   --------------------------------------------------\n\n  I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're\npaying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\neyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\npeople judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n\"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n\n  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:\n  --------------------------------------------------\n>We haven't used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948. \n\nCorrection.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it\nwas well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions\nit in his song \"Black Day in July\".\n  --------------------------------------------------\n\n  Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that\nmeans I was right.  \n\n: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\n: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\n: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\n: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\n: been *big* news.\n\n   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  \n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\n: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\n: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nJohn, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you\nhave to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\nnothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\nneed some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a\nwhile.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. \n\n: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n: it. \n\n   Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\nauthority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\nhad happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\nauthority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\nmassive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\nSome claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\nthe Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also\nheard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\nassert that I claimed they were truth.\n\n: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\n   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \ndifference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \nyears ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\nSo it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\n   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\nwere burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\nam inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\n: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\n: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\n   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\nthat they did fire their guns.\n\n   Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\nthis far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\naccount I cited.\n\n: --John L.

In fact, it is often\nchosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does\nbasically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the\nfact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less\ntraining time required. \n\n\tSmith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht\nthey do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which\nif properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun\nfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and\nwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various \ngun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little\ntest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked\npeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and\nshoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times\nwere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or\nthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.\n\n\tYou don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger\nwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing\ncity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..\n\n\tOf course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but\nsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I\nknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off\nchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that\n'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time\nto draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.\n\n\tDon't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks\nin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,\nit was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the\noperator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I\ndon't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.\n\n\tAs per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree\n100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  \n\n-Just my $.02 + tax\n-------   Steve Syck        syck5280@miller.cs.uwm.edu        --------"

What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals\ncontain a sort of \"gotcha\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even\nif you qualify in every way.\n\n>Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun\n>-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.\n>It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???\n>You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...\n\n       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general\na driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its\nEuropean counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult\nthere than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. \n\n       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different\nthings.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit\nto operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary\nto own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the\nability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise\nfrom the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations\nfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,\nwhich is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get\npast legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public\nproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              \n\n>Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):\n>Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'\n>for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.\n>Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \n>time befor the crime.\n>\n>Use of knives:\n>It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.\n>You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\n>in public -rigth ??\n\n        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have\na difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,\nwhere the laws from one state to another can be as radically different\nas from one country in Europe to another).\n\n        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow\nconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can\nbe either a state or local restriciton.       \n\n>Individual vs masses:\n>Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some\n>extent....\n>Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??\n>What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of \n>all the others ??\n\n       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual\naffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually\nget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within\nthis group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting \nthe rights of some other group.  \n\n       If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you'd\nhave a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase\nsome person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own\nguns\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told\nthat their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's\nrights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited\nby one.\n\n>The issue:\n>I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.\n\n       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to\nwhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.\n\n>We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\n>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\n>But should it have to be like that ??\n\n       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that\nother people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.\nBut currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.\n\n>Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\n\n       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state\nmay enforce it's \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise\nconcept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be\n\"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.\n   \n>If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think\n>it should be free to buy guns ??\n\n       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently\nimplemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue\ngeneration for the State and ignored by a startling number of\ndrivers.

        "content": "UPI Washington DC, Update Desk\t\t\t4/15/93\n\n  For the past several months the Clinton administration has been\n  stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most\n  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the \n  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area\n  of jobs creation.\n\n  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,\n  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed\n  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting\n  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.\n\n  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.\n  \"It's the guns\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other\n  \"gun-nuts\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the\n  economy out of the recession.  \"Their buying them five times faster than\n  ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.  \n\n  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have\n  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several\n  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have\n  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.\n\n  \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said\n  the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we\n  suspect it will\", he added.\n\n  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new\n  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's \n  called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,\n  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index \n  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw\n  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any\n  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the\n  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.\n\n  The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the\n  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run\n  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,\n  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the\n  street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee\n  this program, citing her \"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject\n  of gun control\".\n\n  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an\n  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing\n  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \"Their stockpiling,\n  stockpiling, stockpiling\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference\n  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.\n\n  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment\n  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been\n  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \"First we'll\n  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning\", during a press\n  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate\n  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow\n  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require\n  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,\n  after all of the cards have been drawn.\n\n  The head of the BATF responded by saying, \"We will have to see if this\n  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those\n  guns\".\n\n  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado\n  declared this proposed law as being \"reasonable gun control which won't\n  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\".\n\n  - end article -\n\n  For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-) \n\n                                Bill Vojak\n                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.com\n\t\t\t\tNRA, ILA,\n                                Colorado Firearms Coalition\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

Before\nyou can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club.\nWell, how active can you be without a gun, chief?\n\nMost gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental\ndisorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the\ngovernment.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some\ntrapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you\nare perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.\n\n> It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???\n> You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...\n\nSince the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US \nis around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun\nowners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.\n\nBesides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There\nare about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but\nonly 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot\nof energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.\n\nJust like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring\nsafety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But \nthey already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't \nfund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence \nto those with political connections.  Is this fair?\n\n> Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \n> time befor the crime.\n\nAnd how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets?\nHow many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?\n\n> Use of knives:\n> It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.\n> You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\n> in public -rigth ??\n\nSome states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry.\nSome allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed \ncarry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage\nover another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good,\nthen state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing.\nWhich means that they really don't have any objective reasons for \nthese laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.\n\n> Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive':\n> We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide\n> to take action we DO.\n\n(\"Hot-livered.\"  I LOVE that expression.

The rest of our criminals\naffect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this\nduring the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts\nNO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that\nthe crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to\npossess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens\nwho have lived good lives as if they were just \"pre-felons\" waiting to\ncommit crimes.\n\n> We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\n\nI don't understand this sentence.\n\n> IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\n> But should it have to be like that ??\n\nLife isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or\nflood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car.\nBut pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have\nto do to live in this one.\n\n> Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\n\nNone of ours, I'm sure.\n\n> If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think\n> it should be free to buy guns ??\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone,\neither.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who \ndrive drunk, drive without it!\n\nHowever, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life.\nI rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.\n\n> I'm not a pacifist or anti gun. \n> I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns as\n> neccities or toys.\n> I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn't\n> want to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....\n\nThe question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's\nwhether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do.\nI don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun.\nI do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning\none, too.\n-- \n\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet..."

        "content": "[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]\n\nGun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day\nwith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.\nIt was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,\nwhereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from\nwherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.\n\nMike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\n\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\nmany cases, who they were).\n\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\ndiscuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a\ndelegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\n\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\ninadequate hearing room.\n\nOne of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\n\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\"\n\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\npro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\nseveral Simon's Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\n\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\n\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\nto \"support GOAL's position\" on \"all bills.\"\n\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \n\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\n\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.\n\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\"\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't\nbe having this situation -- but they won't.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\n\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O'Neill.  He was\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\njudge, he'd give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\n\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\n\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\nconvicted.\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.\n\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\ncongressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that\nit's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\n\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\nJujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\nyear it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\nIt's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\nmore effective.\n\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\n\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\n\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\nrambling circumlocution in response.\n\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\n\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\n\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver's license was a\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I'll make you a deal.  You get\nme the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\"\n\nNext came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\nwouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\n\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\nFID's,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\nout-of-staters completely off?)\n\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\nrecord.\n\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\n\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\"\n\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\nGOAL's position) were:\n\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\n\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\n\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\n   opposed)\n\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \n   (opposed)\n\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\n\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\n\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\n\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\n\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\n\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\n\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\n\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\nAgain, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\n\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\nended at about 6:30.\n-- \n\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet..."

I really doubt all of those\noccur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of \"self-inflicted\ngunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters\" is probably\nwell under 250 per year.\n\n>>If you fall, for example,\n>> and land on the handgun or cause a sudden blow, the gun will discharge.\n\nHandguns designs have included a \"hammer block\" since around 1960\nor earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates\nthe cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun\ncannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and\nis pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result,\nmodern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or \nin some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.) \n\n>> The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of\n>> deaths caused by animal attacks or \"wacko\" attacks combined.\n\nI don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders \neach year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest.

Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the\nTreasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities\nwere aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-\ngally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to\nbe used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently\nmade great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-\ntation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before\nBATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence\nwas submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF\ngun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither\ncriminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into\nunknowning technical violations.\n \n( Exerpt from: 97th Congress; 2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT\n     T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S\n                                REPORT\n                                of the\n                   SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION\n                                of the\n                      COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n                         UNITED STATES SENATE\n                        NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\n                            SECOND SESSION\n                             FEBRUARY, 1982\n        Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\n88-618 O\n                        WASHINGTON : 1982\n \n \nLetter to Constituent: April 1993\n \n \nThank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nand Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with\njurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.\n \nIt has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations\nSubcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which\nfunds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly\nprofessional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.\nThe agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in\nsuccessful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use\nof firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It\nenforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory\nminimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an\nillegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in\npreventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk\nyouth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known\ngangs from access to weapons.\n \nThe Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF\non the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession\n(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs\nand other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to\ntrace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where\nthey keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF\nis the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with\nstate and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state\nand local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office\nfelt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally\nestablish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and\nthorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members\nof the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a\nSunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would\nbe separated from the women and children and not in the area where\nit was known that the illegal weapons were stored.\n \nAs you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh\nspiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending\nexecution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the\nelement of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and\nprepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation\npresented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the\nFBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military\ntanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and\nfirepower of the Branch Davidians.\n \nBased on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian\nraid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply\nsaddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who\nattempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the\ncult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a\nthorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside\nthe Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for\nEnforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the\nWaco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the\nevaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick\nand peaceful conclusion.\n \nSincerely,\n \nDennis DeConcini\nChairman\nSubcommittee on Treasury,\nPostal Service and\nGeneral Government\n \nApril 7, 1993\n \n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com"

Notwithstanding the military\n    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are\n    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments\n    are afraid to trust the people with arms.\"\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: \"The right\n    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A\n    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,\n                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free\n    country...\"\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of\n    the militia): \"Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n    a year.\"\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing\n    armies): \"... if circumstances should at any time oblige the\n    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be\n    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large\n    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their\n                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****\n    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.\"\n    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBut *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they\nsaid \"people\", right?

That's why the Right is reserved to the People.

I consider 5' a reasonable space\nlimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to\nthose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at\nwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the\nendangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility\nof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and\ndraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\n\n>They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to\n>protect their homes and families.

With such low\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\n\n>I think it is vital to avoid such a situation, where a small \n>minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power\n>through violence.

But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\ntank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\n\n>Here, I think we have to be carefull about _which_ \"state\" we\n>are talking about: Certainly one role of the militia is to\n>overthrow a repressive government, and it would be completely\n>destructive to that end for that same government to control \n>the militia's arms.

The State having control\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\n\n>That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select\n>militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly-trained\n>specialists.

Just as you argued above that\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\nso one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\n\n>Consider, then, the effect of removing the National Guard's\n>infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local\n>governments.

These would be much more useful to infantry than the\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\nI suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\n\n>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds\n>>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and\n>>the like.\n>\n>I would much rather see these things handled by the local, \n>general militias.\n\n\tSo would I, but the resources often aren't available to\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\nthan anything else.\n\n>Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of\n>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to \n>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry\n>arm of the regular army.\n\n\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\ntrucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\n\n\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\nother responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\nfor these functions.\n\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

It is my opinion that most educated\nor well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.\nThis should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time\nwill tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was \ncreated for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.\nThat and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press\nportrays a group of people as \"nuts\" or crazies, a violation of those\npeople's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the \ngurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the\n2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk \nvoted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with\ndomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.\n  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the \nofficial press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to\npublic safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.\nSo far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very\nagency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their\nadvantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they\nwere portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification\nwhat so ever of doing what they did.\n   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,\nmay mislead the public from the truth of the matter.\n\nJust as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton\nleads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's\n(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be\nunconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).\nAnd since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved\nin this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to \nfind out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.\nIt would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly\nunconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement). \n\n\n****************************************************************************\nThe above opinions are mine and mine only.\nI'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.

        "content": "A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:\n\n1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation\n   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult\n   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit\n   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,\n   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\n\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\n   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\n   you could!\n\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm\n   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\n   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say\n   uncomplimentary.\n\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\n   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\n   the \"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\"\n   flag.  Sigh.\n\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\n   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it\n   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's\n   paranoid delusions.\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>\n\nDan S."

Douglas noted, \"If a powerful sponsor is lacking,\nindividual liberty withers -- in spite of glowing opinions and\nresounding constitutional phrases.\"\n \nThe legislative scorecard outlined below resulted from subcommittee,\ncommittee, and floor action.  Many important victories, however, come\nfrom coordinating with legislators to ensure anti-gun/anti-hunting\nlegislation is either amended favorably, rejected, or never voted.\nThese quiet victories are no less impressive in protecting our\nfundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution.\n \n  ****\n \nArizona - SB 1233, NRA-supported legislation concerning minors in\ncriminal possession of firearms  passed the House 36-18, is currently\nawaiting action by the Governor.\n \nArkansas - HB 1447, Firearms Preemption Legislation was signed by the\nGovernor making this the forty-first state to pass preemption.\nPreemption had passed twice in previous sessions only to be vetoed by\nthen Gov.

HB 1550, repeals FOID and makes FTIP, point of sale\ncheck permanent, passed out of Judiciary Committee by a 10-4-2 vote.\nPresently on the calendar for third reading in the House.\n \nSB 40, mandatory storage bill, defeated in committee.\nSB 265, imposing a handgun excise tax, failed in Senate committee on\nRevenue's Subcommittee on Tax Increases.\nSB 272,imposing a tax on all persons engaged in the business of\nselling firearms, failed in Senate Revenue Committee's Subcommittee\non Tax Increases.\n \nIndiana - SB 241, Statewide Firearms Preemption, passed in the Senate\n34-16, and in the House 77-22.

Despite opposition to the ban --\naired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on\nthe issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the\nreferendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to\nreverse public opinion on the controversial issue.\n \nAn October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found\n57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  By\nelection day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,\n51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to\nhave the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign\ncommittee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,\nrelied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TV\nadvertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications\nraised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.\n \nDespite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madison\ninitiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to have\nthe Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.\n \n                Downloaded from GUN-TALK (703-719-6406)\n                A service of the\n                National Rifle Association\n                Institute for Legislative Action\n                Washington, DC 20036\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com"

        "content": "Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith\n\n                           WEIRD SCIENCE\n\nEveryone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips \nmove.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are \npoliticians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase \n\"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.  \n\nYears ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice \nAge might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke \nand dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international \nunpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even \nhave killed the dinosaurs.  \n\nWhat we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, \nthat real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended \nto discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken \nvalues that made America the most successful culture in history, \nand that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague \nwhen continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  \n\nWe miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William \nSound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't \nsupposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least \n100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never \nknow it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit \ntheir agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and \nthat nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  \n\nBut for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of \nscience as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to \nunscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \"scientists\" \nhave agendas of their own.  \n\nNobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is \ngoing to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that \nthere is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money \nand power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and \nthey hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical \ncrisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  \n\nThe same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up \nby the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private \nindustrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and \nfoisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on \nspecialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  \n\nThe list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  \n\"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and \ncontradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than \na last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era \nwhen state central planning and the command economy have failed and \ncan only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  \n\nDecades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth \nand panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear \npower is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy \nknown to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount \nof energy there is available to any individual in society, the \nfreer that individual -- and his society -- become.  \n\nHonest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and \nself-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as \nideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive \nreductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have \nbeen suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  \n\nAnd what the media didn't say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the \neffect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non-\nsmokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of \nmagnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a \nweek or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether \nthere was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  \n\nThat, of course, is the real threat represented by politically \ncorrect science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice \nto know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy \npractice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's \nscience, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is \nhighly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet \nthe stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There \nisn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of \ngovernment money on the scientific establishment.  \n\nTwo centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies \nto which every other nation in the world has been subject at one \ntime or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and \nreligion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has \ntried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of \nabortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street \n-- has wound up being shed.  \n\nReal human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's \nlives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of \nlivelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, \nto diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels \nfor electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, \nwhen they die from the effects of obesity.  \n\nWhat we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two \nmore centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of \nstate and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; \nreal science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will \nsimply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and \neveryone will benefit.  \n\nL.

I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\nbehind it.  What's going on here?\n\nLet's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\nI'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\nbecause I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\n\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\nhim over the edge.\n\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\n\nLet's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\n\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\nshow the world how big her balls are.\n\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my \nvery soul.\n\nJohn\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?"

        "content": "Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\n\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.\n\nMonday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.\n\nSynopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that\nRandy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National\nFirearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\n\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\n\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\n\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\nWhite cause.\"\n\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\n\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\nof the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\nWeaver otherwise.\n\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\nWeaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must\nhave also been phone taps.\n\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\n\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\nwife's voice on the tape.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\nthis trial is not explained.\n\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\nHarris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.\n\nTuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. \nKenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue."

Did the\npermit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?\n \nWhat the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible.\nThey kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their\nelectrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears\nwith loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept\nlimiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on\nDavid Koresh.\n \nWas the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping\nto get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack\nthe the tanks.\n \nIt appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over\nthe edge.

Would you, say, prohibit female college\nstudents from riding their bicycles near the university during the\ndaytime?  \n\nSounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  Especially when the university is\nlocatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and\nnearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was\nin a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.\n\nWhat do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault\nfor daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she\ndidn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the\ncase, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and\npray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all\nsituations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.  \n\nLarry Sacks\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nlsacks@angelo.amd.com"

What exactly did I claim?\n     --------------------------------------------------\n    \"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\n  to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"\n     --------------------------------------------------\n  \n    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're\n  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\n  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\n  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n  \"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n  \nLater in the same post:\n     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\n  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\n  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\nFine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are\n\"inclined\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\n\nPreviously Awesley had written:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nPrompting me to write:\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nTo which Awesley replied:\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\n  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a\n  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.\n\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But\nthat too is ludicrous.\n\nI wrote:\n  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n  it. \n\nAwesley relied:\n     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\n  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also\n  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\n\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \nArmy tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\n\"this has gone far enough.\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\ndo not.\n\nI wrote:\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\nAwesley wrote:\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \"yes, I\nshelled Americans,\" or \"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\" or \"I\nhelped cover it up\"?\n\nI wrote:\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\nprefer\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\n  that they did fire their guns.\n\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?\n\nAwesley concludes:\n     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\n  this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\n  account I cited.\n\nActually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as\nwell as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last\nword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with\nimpunity--I am dropping the subject.\n\n--John L. Scott"

According\n-> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined \n-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\n-> \n-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\n\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\n\"well regulated malitia.\"  Here is what is says about its character:\n\n\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\n\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\n\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\n\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\n\t character of a well-regulated militia, \n\nIt also talks about the \"well regulated militia\" having a nationally\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \n\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\n\n    \tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n\ta year.\n\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \n\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \n\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\n\n\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \n\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \n\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \n\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \n\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \n\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \n\tNational Guard.\n\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\n\n\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \n\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \n\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \n\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \n\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \n\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\n\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \n\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\n\n\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \n\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n\trecital of particulars.\"\n\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\n\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\n\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \n\t   this puzzle\"\n\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\n\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:\n\t   explain an error\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\nfor \"qualify\" is:\n\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\n\t   of; characterize.\n\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \n\t   task.\n\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\n\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\n\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\n\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \n\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \npeople's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\nme.\n\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\n\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?  I \nforce my version of \"our Liberties and Rights\" by begining statements\nof what \"our Liberties and Rights\" with \"All that the Second Amendment \nclearly states to me.\"   Using expressions, such as \"states to me,\" \nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.\n\nSo in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\nRights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\nthe matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.  For I am only\none person among many and the final word on \"Liberties and Rights\" cleary\nand irrevocably belongs to the many.\n \n+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\n|                             |  \"If only it were a modern document, with a   |\n| John Lawrence Rutledge      | smart index and hyper links stretching all    |\n| Research Assistant          | through the world data net.

If so, just how 'open' does it\nhave to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What\nif one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\nperiod? \n\nQuestion #2\n\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \ntrial for the shooting?\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?\n\nPlease send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g\na little faster than I can handle.

        "content": "First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and\nerudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.\nFrankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of\nthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the\nwritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.\n\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\nMy brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\n\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\nbut are probably similar.\n\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\n\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\n\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \n\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\n\n>No, I simple stated that the people have a right to \"join a well\n>organized militia.\"  And I have also stated that a militia that\n>meets once or twice a year is clearly \"well organized.\"  And this\n>state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a \"right\"\n>to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated\n>by Hamilton. \n\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\n\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\nFederal Courts.\n\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\ntheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\nbe so bold.\n\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\nConstitution.\n \nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \n\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.\n-- \nDonald R.

        "content": "Here is a press release from the White House.\n\n President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A\n To: National Desk\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President \nClinton in a question and answer session with the press:\n\n1:36 P.M. EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\nstandoff ensued.\n\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\ninsane.\n\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\nagents against the compound.\n\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\n\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\nimplementation of the decision.\n\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\n\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\n\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\ncircumstances.\n\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\nhas been learned now.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\nafter 51 days, you decided --\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\nwith --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\nfirst and then the other.\n\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\ncan't do it at once.\n\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\n\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\n\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\nI was given were the following:\n\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\nneeded in other parts of the country.\n\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\nmembers to come out.\n\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\nthe passage of time.\n\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\nunsafe conditions.\n\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\nincrease with the passage of time.\n\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\nsignificance.\n\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\ntoday.\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\nto unfold.\n\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\n\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\n\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\nchildren.\n\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\n\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\ndecide that way?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\nevidence we have.\n\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\njust began to spin downward.\n\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\nThat's what they thought.\n\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\nhave gas masks?\n\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\nyou in agreement with that?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\ncountry.\n\n   (more, more)\n -30-"

The\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\n\n     Q  What federal laws --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\n\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\nwhere they could be protected.\n\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\n\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\n\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\nmind during those horrendous moments?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\n\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\n\n     Thank you.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.\nAnd I do support her.\n\n     She is not ultimately responsible to the American\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as\nwell as she could have.\n\n     Thank you.  (Applause.)\n\n -30-"

Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the\npeople almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are\nthere to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority\ncould vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.\nand it would fly using the logic above.\n\nWhen government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,\nthere is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.

A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting\nthe hangee.\n\nWhat the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the\nlimitations on the government, probably because they know that the\npeople would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind\ntampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has\nbeen very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just\nshows how gullible the people have become to \"I am from the government\nand am here to help you sort of line\".

Glover\n>----------------\n\nThe Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that \nthe two sides have exchanged roles.\n\nThe USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population)\nthan any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California,\nit is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in\nCalifornia is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of\nthese inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police\nnow confiscate property, without trial, under a \"good faith probable\ncause\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug\ndealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a\nmajority will answer \"yes\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and\ndue process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The\nMessage That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't\nknow whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but\nI would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.\n\nAccording to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over\nTWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the\nmarijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own\nbusiness and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves\nthan users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under\nthe \"War on Drugs\" campaign of \"zero tolerance\" due process protections\nhave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have\nproliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians\nwho favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only\nlegal, but political:  \"My fellow Americans, we must send our young\npeople the message that we are serious about winning the War On\nMurder\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun\nprohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine\nthey voted for believing it would be used only on those with different\ntastes in recreational drugs.\n\nWhat goes around comes around.\n\n\n    Alan T.

So I\nintend to put together what I call the \"American Horror File\": a\ncompilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod\nover the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing\nespecially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,\nand financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,\nbut including any other cases for which I can find decent\ndocumentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,\nred-hot enraged at their government.\n\nThe end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text\nand postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent\nyears.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage\npeople to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and\nprint out copies and give them to neighbors.\n\nThis is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on\nhow government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer\ninformation that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific\ninstances of governmental abuses.

If they would of\nhad the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the\ncompound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.\n\n\tIf they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the\n\twarrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they\n\twouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,\n\tHerr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been\n\table to have told such heroic stories about how they\n\t\"protected\" the rest of us from a group of people who\n\tkept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.\n\nThe BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored\ntransports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use\nmore force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to\ndo a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they\nmust have the proper equipment and people to do the job.\n\n\tThe BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group\n\tof Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.\n\nWith the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed\nmore now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is\nthe price we all have to pay for law and order in this country.\n\n\tWell, I figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by\n\teverybody else for this incredibly stupid statement, so I'll\n\tjust let it pass for now.\n\n\tCase Western reserve, huh?

Just so they get the address right, that is...\n\nLook\nat all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country\nof ours.\n\n\tWell, it used to be a great country.  Now I'm not so sure.  \n\tI knew a few of those good people who died in wars;  I was\n\tin Viet Nam.  I can assure you, none of us fought to protect\n\tthe right of the government to attack its own citizens with\n\tmilitary force without provocation.  (Hint: serving a search warrant\n\tis NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault\n\ton a religious group.  At Least not here in the US.  Maybe in\n\tIraq, or Syria...)\n\nWith the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with\nmega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few\nwomen and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn\nto death 51 days later.\n\n\tThis is a joke, right?  Or are they really letting fools like\n\tyou into CWRU now?  Too bad. Used to be a good school.  How'd you\n\tget in anyway, did your old man buy a new wing for the library?"

A tank punched a hole in a wall,\nand as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that\na 30+ mph wind was blowing.  I saw a diagram in USA Today yesterday, and\nfires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made.  A terrible, negligent\naccident.\n\n\n>And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying\n>to get out of the compound?\n\n\nMaybe they couldn't.  I've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive\nin the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire, but it happens all the time.\nWhat if they were in sealed rooms, trying to avoid the gas, and didn't know\nabout the fire until it surrounded them?  Remember the Israelis hiding in\nsealed rooms during Desert Storm to avoid gas-bearing Scuds?\n\nCripes, Mark, are you REALLY a college student?  Maybe you ought to stop\nworrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head.\nEver heard of questioning authority? \n\n>And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.\n\n\nOK, I'll buy that.  You _do_ seem totally clueless...\n\n\n>I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe\n>a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the\ncontrary. \n\nWellllll....  They weren't murderous.  They'd never harmed or even threatened \nanybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons\nand hardware.  And as far as \"evidence\", what are you talking about?  \nEverything the Feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get\nquestioned in detail about it.  Maybe you and your Increased Beverage\nAccess buddies, sitting around the bar slurring stuff like \"they shoulda\nkilled 'em all 51 days ago\" don't feel that way, but then you're probably\none of those people still saying about Klinton \"Give the guy a chance, we don't\neven know what he's gonna do!

Most of our\nminds are apparently more developed than yours.  \n\nThe answer is:  *YES!*  In a f*cking heartbeat!  \n\nThought Experiment:  Would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth \nopen, blissfully sucking up anything the Feds said if Bush were the president?\nWhat, no comeback?  (OK, go ahead, say it.  \"Read my lips, no new taxes\" %^P   )\n\n\n>>But then\n>>again, that is how Mr. Clinton was elected, by people who believe that\n>>his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.\n\n>Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?\n\nNot in such a great degree.  Bush broke one promise, maybe two (taxes/guns)\nand we held him accountable for it.  Of course, it took him the better part of\n4 years to do it;  Slick's only been in office 101 days and he's broken lots\nof them.  Anddd...  I imagine he'll also be held accountable for that.\n\n(I can just see the campaign buttons now:   \"ABC - Anybody But Clinton\")\n\n>So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty\n>people?

I'm eager to know.\n\nHmmm.... Apparently you just got here.  Nobody's claiming that it was anything\nbut a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally\ndon't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up.  And as far as how they picked\nthe Davidians, who knows?  Maybe they figured that nobody'd care about such\na politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the Texas prairie.\nMaybe they figured they'd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs\nduring their religious services (which was the reason the Feds gave for the\ntiming of the raid) rather than running into resistance.  Maybe they KNEW\nthat the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are\ntrying to tell the public.  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing\non the Crips and Bloods.  Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for\napproval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is\nthe case.  Of course, their reasoning doesn't matter, only what they did,\nand this time, people are just paying more attention to it.\n\n\n>And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? \n\nNot if you mean that stupid \"don't stop thinking about tomorrow\"...\n\n>How is he on diabolical laughter? \n\nAll I've ever heard is Hillary's diabolical giggle.  Waffle Man seems to have\nlost his sense of humor...\n\n>Does he look good in a cape? \n\nDon't know, never seen him in one.  He probably looks fat and puffy faced,\njust like in a suit.  I saw him in the Rose Garden the other day, and I\ncouldn't get over how much he is starting to look like Teddy Kennedy.\n\n\n>These things MUST be investigated.

It must be \ninterpreted and applied with that end in view.\"\n\nThe militia includes \"all males physically capable of acting in concert \nfor the common defense.\"\n\nHowever, regarding sawed-off shotguns, \"certainly it is not within \njudicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military \nequipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\"\n\n\"Judicial notice\" is the term of art here -- it meant that no such\nevidence had been formally presented.  This is different from claiming\nthat they had ruled that it wasn't.\n\n> Yes, shotguns had been used in WWI, the Spanish-American War, and the\n> US Civil War. That was not in question. The possession of a sawed-off\n> shotgun was, i.e., a weapon altered to improve concealibility.\n\nI'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short-\nbarrelled (\"sawed-off\") shotguns in war.\n\nCompare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American \nWar; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by\nUS soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to \"tunnel rats\" \nin Vietnam, but, of course, \"Miller\" took place in 1939.\n\n> >> Therefore, US vs. Miller supports limited government regulation of \n> >> firearms.\n> >\n> >Don't go arguing down this road unless you are willing to abide by \n> >the consequences that you find at the end of it -- mainly, that the\n> >law-abiding common man has a right to own any weapon that has a militia \n> >purpose, from handguns to sawed-off shotguns and fully automatic weapons.\n> >That, in fact, is what this decision says.\n> \n> You are free to produce evidence that I'm not willing to abide with\n> all the implications of this. \n\nHere is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of \nguns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument \nunless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs\nin that class.  \n\nI think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe \nwe also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments \nhave been banning or trying to ban because they have \"no sporting purpose\" \nand \"no provate citizen would ever need these guns\" DO fall under the \nprotection of the Second.  \n\nSo, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at \nsome time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship \ntraining purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing \nthis point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.\n\n> Just because I don't whole-heartedly endorse the NRA position does not\n> mean that I oppose the RKBA.

Therefore, \"the right \n>of the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \n>regualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \n\nAh, clarification by obfuscation.\n\nActually, the words \"A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state\" is a present participle, used as an\nadjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of\nthe sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It\nasserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for\nmaintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or\nstate or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other\nthan the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a\nright of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,\nFourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.\nThe existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the\namendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right\nto bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of\na free state.\nIn other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and\nbear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.\n\n\n>So in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\n>Rights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\n>the matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.

        "content": "This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n==============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nWednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \"evil\" federal\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\nagents \"sawed off\" shotguns and later failed to appear for\ntrial: Despite repeated \"good faith\" efforts to get Weaver\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\nwere taking an \"offensive action\" against an FBI helicopter\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\n\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\nalleged, want to become a \"regular supplier\").  The defense also\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\nhe wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\nangle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\nWeaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to \"look at the body\" [not recover?]\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\n\nProsecution quote: \"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\nthat confrontation.\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\n\nDefense quote: \"The evidence in this case is going to show that\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\nwith crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that\nthe government did commit.\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\n\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\n\"Tim\" again.  \"Tim\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \"ordinary,\nworking class people.\"  He also claimed he was for \"white pride,\nnot white power.\"\n\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\n\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\nrecounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the \"sawed\noff\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\ngood one!).\n\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\nbegin presenting evidence.\n\nDrew\n=============================================================\n\n\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************"

        "content": "This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n=============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nThursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.\n\nThis day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\n\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\n\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\n\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\nStriker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\n\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\n\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\n\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\nand fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\nBill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\n\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\"  Nevin also\npointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\ndecided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\nhim [no answer was available].\n\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\n\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\n\nDrew\n==============================================================\n\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************"

Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places?\n: In particular, three different places where there were no APV's?\n\nThe crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins\nof the BD compound.  The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was \ncrushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited, \nwould look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV \nnews.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off.\nPropane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent \nwith what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm...\n\n: And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying\n: to get out of the compound?\n\nRemember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.\nConflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being\nworn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those\non the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they\nthought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to\nput it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and \nconcussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable\nof moving.\n\n: And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.\n\nGood question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the \nthings that the FBI said (\"The BD's started the fire.\"  \"The BD's bodies\nwere found with gunshot wounds.\") that are now being refuted by the \nevidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making\nstatements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make\nthem sound like fact.  \n\n: I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe\n: a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the\n: contrary. Thought Experiment: Suppose this exact same thing happened under\n: the Bush administration. What would your answer be then? Would you still\n: prefer to believe the cultists?\n\nYes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop\nstring of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations\non numerous occasions.\n\nAnd as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until\nthey were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If\nthe BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be\ndead today?  \n\n: (No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.)\n\n: >But then\n: >again, that is how Mr. Clinton was elected, by people who believe that\n: >his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.\n\n: Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?\n\nYes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Now\nif we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of\napologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expected\naccountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco would\nhappen as often as they do.\n\n: So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty\n: people? Are they, like, just plain evil, or what? Did they just wake up\n: one day, stretch and yawn, and throw a dart at a map of the United States\n: to figure out who to oppress that day? I'm eager to know.\n\nAcutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of\nthis sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.  \nOddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after\nthe initial raid on the BD's.  \"Coincidence?  I think not!\"\n\nAnd as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over\nwalls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince\nthe world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by\nthe investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to \na gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the\nbuilding.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to \ncover its ass.  \n\n: And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? How is he\n: on diabolical laughter? Does he look good in a cape? These things MUST be\n: investigated. You first.\n\nOh, please.  If you want to argue, argue.

I'm\nsorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning\naccidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern,\nbut in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun\ncontrol measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one.\nThe fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may\nbe, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking.\n\n>>Please explain why you think \"symbolic offerings\" do good.\n>>\n> My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police\n>departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by\n>giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond\n>to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.  Overall, I thought that I\n>had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were\n>useful.\n\nSorry if it wasn't clear to me.  I thought you were waffling on your view\nof buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully\npreventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on\nall these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who\naren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to\ncommit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a\npositive way for police to respond to \"interpersonal violence.\"\n\n>>I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these \"statistics\" - I\n>>suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of\n>>students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun)\n>>to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students\n>>who carry a gun to school daily.\n>>\n> Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence\n\nWhat, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit\nsuicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL\nMETHODS per year?  Who do you think I should believe?  The people who call\neveryone up to age 24 \"children\" when they're screaming about the \"carnage\nof our nation's children\" being caused by handguns?\n\n>or the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nAh, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be\nsuch a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People\n2000 document is to \"enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of\nhandguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the\nlikelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?\"  The\nagency that funded the \"study\" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban\nhad saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of\na look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?\nIt wasn't their fault that the population of DC dropped in their \"post law\"\nperiod...\n\n\n>  If YOU look carefully you will see\n>that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.\n>The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that\n>400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.

I'll\nretract my dispute of your numbers.  However, I would be greatly interested\nin seeing how CPHV and CDC came up with these numbers.\n\n>  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key\n>children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access\n>to guns in their home.\n\nWhat's this got to do with anything?  Hell, when *I* was in elementary\nschool I came home to an empty house with guns in it.  Why is this a\nproblem?  I didn't touch the guns - I had been taught not to.  I had also\nbeen taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the\ncar, the knives, the oven, and the tools.  The problem is not the guns,\nit's the parents!!!\n\n>  California schools reported a 200% increase in\n>student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between\n>1988 and 1990.

These are the \"statistics\".\n\nAnd what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns?\nNOTHING.  No criminal prosecution, no expulsion, in most cases not even\nsuspension.  They take the gun, slap the kids on the wrist, say \"ain't it\nawful,\" and go on as if everything's back to normal.  What's wrong with\nthis picture?\n\n> Okay, maybe I worded it wrong...DAD.

Covey\n\n\n\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \n \n\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\nhere. \n\n\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\ntake the bus?  \n\n\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\n\n\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\nhomes unaccounted.\n\n\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\nsix counts:\n\n\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\ncriminological hogwash.\n\n\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\ncrucially affect the risk. \n\n\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\nthe matter.\n\n\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\ndisregard this issue.\n\n\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \n\n\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\n\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \n\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \n\n\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\n\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com"

This was even during the 9 month period when he was being\nwatched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned\naccording to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting\nthem, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted\nto have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell...\n\nHe was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered\npeacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully).\nHe has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY.\n\nThe justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased\n$200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period).\nLast I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one.  I know of an\nINDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door\nshoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first, nobody I\nknow of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...').  Can you?\nI sure cannot.  Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated\nlike the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so, it\nis a 'so what' issue...

I am inclined to think a further wait\nwould have saved lives.

You think she is going to be\nfacing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal?  You think\nshe is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found to\nhave acted wrongly?  I don't.  It is a nice PR gimmick, though.\n\nI am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation\nfor possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI.\nI expect to hear \"they are our best law enforcement.

My opinion is that the agent\nin charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,\nmurder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend\nthe Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the \npublic what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault\non American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,\nthe Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for\nBATF wrongdoing.\n\nJames\n\nbtw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.\n\n\n\n-- \n********************************************************************************\nJames S.

Why don't you do the same.\n\nSome more interesting facts about the Waco incident:\n\n1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing\n    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least\n    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify\n    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as\n    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to\n    be police.\n    \n2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:\n    + \"We only had handguns\" - the original footage showed 4 BATF\n      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5\n      assault sub-machine gun.\n    + \"We were out gunned\" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the\n      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you\n      have the best guns available for the job.\n    + \"We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!\" -\n      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot\n      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that\n      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\n      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly\n      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are\n      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter\n      plywood.\n    + \"We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.\n       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.\n       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.\n       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.\"\n      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily\n      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.\n      \n3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one\n    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would\n    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did\n    AND that they are surprised that he did.

How would the city law apply to your impending \n|trial for the shooting?\n\nIt wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident\nin Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a\nhandgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand,\na black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend\nhimself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA\nDirector who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided\nnot to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs\nhas it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his\nhouse, and told him: \"this is stepping over the line; this could get\ndangerous for you.\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers\nwatched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief\nand his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.\n\n|Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\n|shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \n|either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \n\nL.V.

As long as Democrats reign in Chicago, Illinois\nresidents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. Politicians\nget around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry\nconcealed weapons. Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes\nout of office; because the Dems are always in power, the Illinois \nSupreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party's views on guns.\n[All candidates supported by political consultant David Axelrod are\nanti-gun, which explains anti-RKBA Crook County States Attorney \nJack(ass) O'Malley being a so-called \"Republican.\"]\n\nGet rid of the Chicago Democrats, get rid of their members on the IL\nJudiciary, and you got a fighting chance of a preemption law and a CCW\nlaw..."

This directory can be used for things like\narticles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,\nthe RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not\nmeant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.\n\nSo, in the future if you're looking for something check there first\nand then ask here.\n\nInstructions:\n\nShort version for techies:\n\nThe site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the\ndirectory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands\nget, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \"type binary\"\nto be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved\nto the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.\n\nI will maintain an index which you should get first to check if\nthe file you want to read or write already is archived.\n\nLong version for non-techies:\n\nIn order for you to use this archive your computer must be on\nthe Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:\n\n\tftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu\n\nIf that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp\ncommand is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a\nlogin:\n\tName (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):\n\nInstead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:\n\n\tftp\n\nNext you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:\n\n\tGuest login ok, send e-mail address as password:\n\nI would enter:\n\n\tl.v.cipriani@att.com\n\nYou'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines\nor similar as output:\n\n\tRemote system is UNIX.\n\tUsing binary mode to transfer files.\n\nNext, the command prompt is printed:\n\n\tftp> \n\nIf you do not get the line \"Using binary mode to transfer files.\"\nRun the command:\n\n\ttype binary\n\nNow you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many\ndirectories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are\n\n\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nand\n\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nThere are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.\n\nWhen you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive\nfiles change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:\n\n\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nor\n\tcd pub/firearms/politics/rkba\n\nTo submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with\nthe command:\n\n\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\nor\n\tcd pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nOnce you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter\nanother command.\n\nTo find the names of the existing files in the directory you are\nin run the command:\n\n\tls -l\n\nThis will produce something like:\n\ntotal 6021\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias\n-r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu\n... and so on ...\n\nEach line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields\nare the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of\nthe file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need\nto be concerned with.\n\nTo get a file run the command \"get\" followed by the name of the file\nyou want, for example:\n\n\tget INDEX\nor\n\tget noduty\n\nAfter the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:\n\n\tTransfer complete.\n\t19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)\n\nYou can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.\nYou can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the\nfile you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025\nyou should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first\nand then retrieve it:\n\n\tcd congress/103rd\n\tget HR1025\n\nOnce you're finished you can log off with the command:\n\n\tquit\n\nIf you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little\ndifferent.  First of all you should find out if the file already\nexists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above\nand look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The\nindex will have a description of each of the files in the rkba\ndirectory.  For example:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFile: whitemanslaw\n\nWhite Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985\nReason magazine\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login\nand change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once\nyou are in the incoming directory use the command:\n\n\tput file_name\n\nIn this case:\n\n\tput whitemanslaw\n\nAgain there'll be a \"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered\nin so many seconds\" message.  Now your file is on the archive\nmachine.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure\nthere isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same\nas the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll\noverwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].\n\nYour file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a\nfile by the same name in the rkba directory.\n\nOnce your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for\nthe INDEX file and I will add it to the file.\n\nIf you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute\na file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.\n\nIf you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so\nbe sure to let me know first.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nMichael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..\n                (internal) mjp@bwa.kgn.ibm.com .. mjp at kgnvmy         \n (and last but not least a disclaimer)  These opinions are mine.."

Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary.\"\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] \"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] \"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion.\"\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

I'm not saying if that is a good thing\nor not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun\nbuyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are\nhaving an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatory\ncomponent to the program, they say \"well no...\"  So, in answer to your\nquestion, no, false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is to\nshow folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal\ngun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you can't measure\nthe impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test\nevaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.

        "subject": "Waco Questions",
        "content": "Folks,\n\nIt's time to start building some precise questions to send to our\nfederal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our\nlocal TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be\nasked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \n\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\n     the BATF obtained?\n\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \n     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant \n     in a manner prescribed by law?\n\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\n     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \n\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\n     dispossessed weapons.\n\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\n\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\n     situation? \n\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\n\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\n\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \n     penetrated?\n\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\n\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\n\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\n     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is \n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\n\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \n     shots from high-power rifles?\n\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\n\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************"

        "subject": "Re: JFFO has gone a bit too far",
        "content": "Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:\n\n1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\nthe book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\nlaw; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, \nurban-folklore style.\n\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't \nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\n\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\nlaw registry].\"\n\nBingo.  Exactly.  \n\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there's absolutely no reason to \nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \nherrings.\n\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \nto have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd \ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \nwouldn't he?\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it\non their own?\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd's motivation isn't a \nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\n\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\" -- so \nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\n-- \n\t\t\t\t\t-- Don Porges\n\t\t\t\t\tporges@inmet.camb.inmet.com\n\t\t\t\t\t..uunet!inmet!porges"

He left his third-floor bedroom and began\nlooking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and \nchecking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    \ncompound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.\n   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them\nwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the \nsix said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    \nsince Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's \nphone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the\ncults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.\n    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel\ncompound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD\nmeanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the\nwomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all\nunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    \nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\nit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.\nHundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling\nthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than\nthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\nother flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked \ntogether with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's\nescaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others\ndied groping in the blackness.\n\nFrank"

Wright\n\n(1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct\n    sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.\n\nOnly about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most\nrecent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a\nlicensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six --\nobtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving\nfriends and associates, family members, and various black market\noutlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources\nincluded cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and\noften theft.

Kopel\n\n     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville.\nThe study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous\ncriminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable\nimpact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns\nare purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.\n\n51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal\nEnforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of\n20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;\nof those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who\ncommitted crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)\n(of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony\nconvictions, and .4% had violent convictions).

The NU study, authored by\nsociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent\nof criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The\nfigures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the\ncriminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents\nof gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and\nprobably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of\nguns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime\ndirectly target the black market in criminal guns, and\nleave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wright\nbelieves that the consequences of current \"assault weapon\" legislation on\nstreet violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun\ncontrols aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of\ncriminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new\nbusiness.{100}\n\n6.   _See, _e.g., The Anti-drug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

It's one\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\n\n       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \nthemselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\nthe evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\npeople jump off buildings.)\n\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn't mean they\nweren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\nkid might.\n\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\nkilled.\n\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\nbusinesses.)\n\n>Studies by the \n>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence\n>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member\n>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.\"\n\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I\nwill point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\n\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\nit's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

        "content": "The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article\non Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal\ntacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.\ntype folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,\nand surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.\nThe Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student\n(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...\n\n(The title was the only thing they changed/added)\n\n\"Gun Stats\"\n\nThe Daily recently reprinted an article from the\nWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton\nQuigley, author of \"Armed and Female.\"  The article,\nin turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally\nreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The\narticle states, \"A study... found that a gun in the home\nwas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,\nspouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.\"  This\nis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-\neral reasons, outlined below:\n\nThe study gives the impression that, if you own a \ngun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to \ndefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned\nagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take into\naccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun \nto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-\ntrator.\n\nThe study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather\nthan 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\nfriend.\n\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample \nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\n\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be \nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an \naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a \ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies \nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\nused to commit suicide.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can \nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has\nto consider carefully what questions were asked by\nthose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-\nrate conclusion from them.\n\nD.F.

The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. \nUnfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits \nrequired approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally \nout to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local \ncommunity volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By \nthe time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame \nand it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers \nand no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, \nbut the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not \nhave one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the \nline of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient \nequipment and water to make a difference.\n\nThey even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia \nasking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably \nirresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local \ncalls could get through.\n\nABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who \nviewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the \nstandard \"pool shot\"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been \nstarted in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant \nto spread so fast.\n\nNeither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed \nthemselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot \nstronger proof than some of the \"theories\" floating around the net.\n\nScore 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians.

Congress can not\narbitrarily ban a substance or product.  That is why prohibition came into\neffect, only by passing an ammendment.   What you said about constitutionality\nof law needs to be clarified.  I believe that an unconstitutional law was \nnever constitutional.  When a law is determined by the Supreme Court, to be\nunconstitutional, that law was never really a law.  The very nature of the law\nbeing unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception.  Please correct\nme if I'm wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyone\nconvicted of breaking that law is absolved.\n   I don't believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court.

If they needed\nto assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the\nfederal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type\nassaults all the time.  And they are very, very good about it, in both the\ntactical and legal parts of it.

But they had to use their own\nguys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun\ncontrol.   \n\n\tI also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. \nInitial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their\n\"assault weapon\" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget\nwas going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno got\nconfirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line);\nright around the presidents 100th day in office.

However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,\nhomemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate\nfire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall\nthe tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for\nuse by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of\neffective fire beyond a few feet.

His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of\narms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way of\nrationality could be expected from Koresh, a self-\nconfsesed \"sinner without equal.\"\n\tWhat continues to mystify are th eactions of\nfederal agents, who bungled the case from the\nstart.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when\n100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-\nbacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent\non seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap-\nons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem-\nbers died inteh ensuing gun battle.

Fifty-one days into \nthe siege there was no public outcry to storm the\ncompound.\n\tIt had been correctly perceived that the chil-\ndren inside \"Rancho Apocalypse\" were essentially \nhostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no\nreason for the government to be impatient.  The\ngovernment's superior firepower, control of water\nand utilities and freedom of movement created the\nconditions for a belated but bloodless resolution.\n\tNeither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the\nFBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for\nabandondoning the course of patience.\n\tIf intelligence was accurate and Koresh was\ngrowing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi-\ncult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an\nM-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re-\nports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they\nwould have to be weighted against the potential for\neve ngreated hamr.\n\n\netc etc tec....\n[paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted]\n\nBut some of the responsibility rests with Clinton,\nand inexperienced president who did not pay\nenough attention to the life-and -death decisions\nbeing made on WAco.\n\tIf Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would\nbe for her overreliance on the judgment of law en-\nforcement officers--a common problem among\nprosecutors.\n\tFull investigations into th eWaco tragedy must\nbe conducted by both the executive and legislative\nbranches.

I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported\non in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action\nis as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a \nweapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!)\nand that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile \naction he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!)\nRepeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking\ngun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and\nI will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's\n ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's\npracticality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45)\nIF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER\nWILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not\nbother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a\nBystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!)\ncall the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on \nthe ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will\nuse it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and\nthat of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none\ncame forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded\nwith the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special\npurpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing\nlawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you\nfully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can\nthink of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the\nGlaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose\nand stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court.\n(ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not \nricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often\ncross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with\none shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court.\nBe as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were.\nRepeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the\nsame questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see\nif your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification\nand weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your\n politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are\nrequired in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to\nhold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one,\ncontact the NRA. They have a legal assistance fund.(Or at least they used to)\nI DO HOPE YOUR A MEMBER! (Not my business either way though..)

A gun kills people.  \n\nRather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\n\n>But let's ignore guns for defence and/or crime and look at gun accidents.\n\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\n\n...\n>But seriously: a gun is designed to fire a bullet.   This is not so you\n>can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range.\n\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\nwould, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\nkill people.\n\n>This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show\n>someone  that you have a gun and they go \"Gee, perhaps I should leave\".\n\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\nof firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\n\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\nthe best.[3]\n\n>No, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human\n>body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow, for most.\n\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\naren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\n\n\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\ngovernment.\"\n\t- T. Jefferson.\n\nI think what Jefferson said is still true.\n\n>And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes\n>off into the wrong fleshy target.\n\nNot very often compared to other use.[3]\n\n>Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife.\n\nThis isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \"get-pissed\" and kill\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\npeople wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.\n\n>Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to\n>kill things.  Right?\n\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\nnever have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\nI don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm\nafter, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\nparticularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.\n\n\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\n\t48700 deaths by auto\n\t11300 deaths by fall\n\t 5300 deaths by drowning\n\t 4800 deaths by fire\n\t 4400 deaths by poison\n\t 3200 deaths by food\n\t 1400 deaths by firearm\n\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\n     \"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\".

        "content": "Posted for L. Neil Smith by Cathy Smith\n\n\n                         THE LIES OF TEXAS\n\nOkay, what have we learned?\n\nFor reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known \n-- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative \ncommittees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard\nof the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and \npersonal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the \nFirst, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe Constitution. \n\nThe man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw \nagency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own \nlosses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his \nelectricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside \nworld. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in \npronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency \nfinds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit \neager to gain credit for \"straightening out the mess\" -- and, more \nimportantly, to script his side of the subsequent \"negotiations\" \nany way they please. \n\nThe impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time \nfour L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a \nsingle individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. \nArmored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers \nusing scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious \nrecords at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive \nthose in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority \nwill mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean \nCommunists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). \n\nFinally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising \nof the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house \nand gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and \nis reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, \nincluding those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. \n\nSpokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the \nPresident all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: \nblame the victim. \n\nHe had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a \nsecret government workshop and planted among the cinders being \n\"examined\" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children \n-- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. \nHe set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in \n3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that \nJim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to \nembarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was \nsevered at the start of the whole travesty. \n\nA leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe \nthat a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow \nresponsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever \nknow 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound \nmore like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? \n\nVery well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never \nforget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and \nrightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, \nit was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which \nmay explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage \nand integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) \nabout the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a \nmouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. \n\nMore importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower \nof Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance \nas Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the \nsystem, then at least within yourself. \n\nOn March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of \nthe Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw \nagency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised \nin its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both \nagencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped \nto write that plank. \n\nTrue, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in \n1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone \nin a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their \nbehinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what \nhappened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, \nWaco never would have happened. \n\nThink about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough \nof political parties more interested in collecting and holding \npower -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human \nlife -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe \nthe change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less \ntiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.\n\nThink about it.\n\nL.

        "subject": "NO SURRENDER -- Lenda Jackson",
        "content": "NO SURRENDER!\nDelivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993\n\nIt is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel\nthreatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are\nimmediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid\nof. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The\nstranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the\nhouse as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The\nmugger...the rapist. \n\nAnd what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door\nlocked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and\nalways, there's the implied question \"what's a pretty little thing like\nyou doing without a husband around to protect you?\n\nBut what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10\nyears to devote learning judo?\n\nWhat if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that \"rape victims\nusing armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -\nand were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any\nother form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for\nrobbery/assault)(Kleck,123) \n\nWhat if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend\non the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a\ncrime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that\nthe police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the\nwhole community.\n\nAs a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice\nthemselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to\nhelp themselves?\n\nHere's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says\n\"no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-\npound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out.\" But if\na woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient\nmeans possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.\n\"Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!\" they ask. How could you\nhurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from\nyou. In truth, 1% of \"defensive gun uses\" result in the offender taking\nthe gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)\n\nWell, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already\nmade that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be\nvictimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more\nguns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching\nothers, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are\npreparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.\nWe're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're\ngoing to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE\nINTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.\n\nBut there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more\nsecretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.\n\nThat menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that\ngovernments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed\npeople. It's the way they survive.\n\nIn our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people\nboth at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and\nthreatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next -\nwhat freedom we will lose because some government goon decides\n\"it's for your own safety\" or \"we know best\". Any person who acted\nlike government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his\nlife and locked up as a habitual offender.\n\nBut this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who\nshould be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt\nme? Then why did you file your income tax? \n\nLike any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something\nthat can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's\nreally after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're\nafter me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,\nMetzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for\nour assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. \n\nAs citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices\ngiven to women: to surrender or to fight. \n\nSurrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the\ndisappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. \n\nA battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep\nthe government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if\nthey have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:\n\"the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.\"\n\nAs a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will\ndo my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,\nand speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always\nremember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it\ncan lead to Tiananmen Square. \n\nWhen the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep\nthem from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,\nI intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter\nwhat laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more\nsubstantial in my hand than a brick. \n\nMy opinions are, of course, my own."

If I remember correctly (please correct\nme if I'm wrong) the switch would set to an \"off\" position or an \"on\" position\nbecause the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  Wouldn't the M-16 have a position\nfor semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is\ncorrect wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course\nif the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that\neasy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16.\nHow about the other guns?

        "content": "In the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions with\npeople from this group.  In particular, we discussed how cults\noperate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave\nthe way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing\nwith cults and similar organizations.\n\nI include an edited account of what I wrote.  The identity of my\ncorrespondents have (I hope) been erased.  The editing process makes\nthe text choppy - sorry about that.  I've tried to retain the\ninformation content.\n\nEllipses (...) indicate where text was removed.  A few of the comments\nin parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders to\nunderstand.\n\nThese notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize.\n\nCheers(?),\nOded\n\n------------------------ (begin included text) -----------------------\n\nI took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ...  The course included\ncults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external\nreading too).\n\nWilliam Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of\n\"evil\" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what\nwould motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,\nand by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think\nthe books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced\n..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I\nthink they're onto something.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\tHow cult psychology works...\n\t[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]\n\nSo long as Koresh could \"own\" his people, he made sure they didn't\nbelieve there was any life out there for them, away from him.\nOtherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians\nrecounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived\nonly through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.\nAbsolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they\nbelieved him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even\nthe Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left\nhim, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces\nof the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)\ncouldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die\ntoo, like the folks in Jonestown.\n\nFor a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife\n(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then\nthemselves.  That's the consequence of shattered \"cultism.\"  It really\ndoes happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such\ncases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no\nmatter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]\n\n...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?]\n\nI agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good\n(?)  reasons for news blackouts.\n\n>\tThe only fact available is that had the FBI not acted  \n>\tyesterday, those people would be alive today.\n\n ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh\nmade sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.\nHence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He\nheld them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing\nwould really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!\n\nLook at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,\nat the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once\nJonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his\nentourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd\nbe busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought\nup by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are\ntapes...  The \"logic\" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it\nwouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people\nwho brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by\nTHEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the\nsame with the Branch Davidians.\n(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER\nWHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)\n\n...\nThe only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate\nreports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying\nfull-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the\noff chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...\n\nSo, the only way the BATF/FBI could \"save\" those people, and future\ncults, is by ignoring such signs.\n\nI suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him\ninto letting them go, or somehow influencing \"his\" people to abandon\nhim while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.\n... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that\nwith blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe\nthey're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's\ncertainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.\n\n...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]\n\n    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from\nKoresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.\n\n    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd\nwant to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning\nboneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_\nplaying chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at\ncheckmate time people really die, and I could be blamed.\n\n...\n\nI don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you\ndeny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and\nthe rest of the gummint should exist at all. \n\n\t\t(the end)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t\t\t  Okay, have at it."

While this may not seem right,\nor it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command\nleading to the White House, thats the way it is.

I'm not sure if\nthey should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses\nare a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority\nreligion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of\ncults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.\nKoresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do\nnot practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is\ndigging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are\nassociated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about\nwould not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt\nBATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was\nunjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S\ngovernment is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I\ndo believe that some of the things that former cult members have said\nare true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President\nClinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives\nshould be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from\nreaching its full potential."

I'm just getting started with this\ntype of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low.\n\nComments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed.\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nEditor, \n\nI would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to\nthe \"right to keep and bear arms\", and to a greater degree, the many other\n\"rights\" that we take for granted on a daily basis. \n\n1.\tYou're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  You\ncall the police.  How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while\nyou are waiting for the police to arive? \n\n2.\tYou are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A \"good\nsamaritan\" stops to \"help\", when you find you and your family at gun-point or\nknife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family? \n\n3.\tYou are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appears\nsuddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are you\nstrong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rape\nyou in order to survive the attack? \n\nIf the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep\nand bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun\nmay not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going\nto let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to\ndefend yourself and your family? \n\nMany times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If\ncertain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm\nammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law\nenforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition\nfor use in your handgun. \n\nThere is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feel\nthat any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for\nthe purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?\n\nOur local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,\nor in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   while\nwaiting for help to arrive. \n\nThere is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit\nthe sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  One\nelected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! \n\nI want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected\nofficials decided that they should only belong to a \"certain church\", or go to\nchurch on a \"partiular day\"?  What if you were told that you could only read\ncertain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had the\nright to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peaceful\nmanner? \n\nThese are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments.\nIf we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fight\nfor the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  When your life\nis affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights by\ndefending your Second Amendment rights."

It is an instrument that\ncan be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose,\nand despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers\nsupply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass\ndestruction is rather a given.\n\n\tIt's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not\nsee a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly\nimpossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some\npretext or another.  The looser your definition, the more ripe for\nabuse that law is.  Furthermore, if you get specific then the old\nstandby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to\nbe added to, generally without going through the hassles of another\nvote and public reading of the law.  Again, ripe for abuse.\n\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

        "subject": "Don Kates' talk on the Branch Davidians",
        "content": "This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:\n\nI recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk\nat the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was\nall set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy\nconclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough\nsummary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as\nexactly what he actually said...\n\nKates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire\nthan the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not\ndiscuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.\n\nKoresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This\nisn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has\nbeen ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel\nhatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to\npeople like Koresh.\n\nLengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.\nThere were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.\nPolice originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they\ncalled local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for\nprotection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were\nchanged to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many\nsmall police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not\nlarge enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of\norganizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the\nFBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they\nwere to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).\n\"All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that\npower.\"\n\nThe BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid\nillegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners\nno longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills\ndisappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its\nexistence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.\nAround the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media\nis alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a\npre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door\nand the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a\ngun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't\ninvited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but\nif any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents\nremoving armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in\nchains.\n\nThe Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for\nreview.\n\nKates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and\nthat the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot\nat, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100\nagents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had\nsome medical personnel on hand.\n\nHe confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest\nin connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on\nthe phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and\nthe sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could\nbe tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns\nback.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached\nrationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.\n\nThe BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they\naudit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his\nfollowers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and\nthey reacted accordingly.\n\nWith respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates\nwas giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that\nthe BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their\ninformants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had\nmore to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been\ncompletely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to\nknock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for\nthus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,\nthen it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns\ndown the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF\nbreaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the\nDavidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served\nwarrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A\nclose look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_\nhave shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was\nthe first shot fired!\n\nThe role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial\nposition on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the\nview that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held\noff a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI\nwent in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was\nbeginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the\npublic's sympathy.\n\nShould the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,\ndiverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents\nlike this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,\nwell-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have\neven more tragic results.\n\n   - Lyn Bates\n     (bates@bbn.com)\n\nPS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston\nCollege Law School next Tuesday, April 27.  I don't know the exact time or\nplace, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that\ninformation.\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com"

Besides,\nthe ranch house (not \"fort apocalypse\"; it was just a house despite what\nthe FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The \"Gun loonies\" couldn't hardly\nhave been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.\nThe FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there\nto put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well*\nunder way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't\neven tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that\nthe FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in\nthis fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.\nSomeone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.\n\nSadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media\nand the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it\nup as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American\npeople will probably believe them.\n\n> Next question.\n> \n> \n> The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters\n> to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place.\n\nThis is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that\nis becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns\n*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On\nthe other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal\nguns then the government did have the right to search their compound.\nBut, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons\nhasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke\nany laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this\nis his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.\nThe ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol\nviolations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should\nstay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of\ntheir jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.\n\n> The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to\n> attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had\n> had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type\n> raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.\n\nSounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults\nalike---should be treated with respect---even if they are \"heavily-armed\nreligious wackos\".\n\nDavid Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out\npeacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON\nTHEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause\nthis senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE\nLIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.\n\n> It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity \n> to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead\n> he ordered the murder of the children.\n \nDon't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the\ncult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that\nit knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on\nfire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions\nof committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.\nTherefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED\nEVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still\ndon't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the\nWaco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.\n\n> In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive\n> the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the \n> suicide/murder of his other 80 followers.

They\nhad MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic\npistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later\nretracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.\n\n> The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely.

I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental\ndeaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents.\nWhat is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths?\nI am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a\njustification for gun control.

If YOU look carefully you will see\nthat YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.\nThe CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that\n400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates\nthat 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once\nin 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key\nchildren (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access\nto guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in\nstudent gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between\n1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in\nschools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the \"statistics\".\n \n \n \n>>thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah (Got news\n>>for you folks, if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours\n>>presently, he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they\n>>were in danger).\n>\n>\"Holding kids?\"  Time for a reality check, son.

He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off, he saw he was being\nATTACKED with no overt action from him (yet).  He could no more say 'oh,\nits ok, its only stun grenades' anymore than I could.  He slammed the door at\nthat point and proceeded to repel the attackers.  He felt in genuine fear\nof his life - I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point.  Have\nyou ever been shot at?  How clear and logically could you think, under\nthat pressure, when you MIGHT have ALL OF 1 or 2 SECONDS to evaluate\nwhat is going on?  And, it would not be the first time that 'law\nenforcements' intended to bring in their suspect horizontally.  For\nall we know, he was informed by someone saying something like \"Hey,\nguy, the BATF is coming like gangbusters, and they mean to WASTE you...\"\n\nAccording to the latest news, the released warrant (so we are told) said\nthe reason for this WW III raid was that Korash's group had spent around\n$200,000.00 on firearms and related stuff (over an undetermined period).\nNow, even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do a\ndrug siezure, for 90 people, that isn't really all that much (you priced\ndecent guns lately?).  Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably\nhas that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he is\nan avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal,\nnor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also note\nthat the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, what\nis the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad\nfor some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming\nthe unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?\nThis administration has only one thing in mind.  CONTROL.  PEOPLE CONTROL.\nWhether it is gun control, Clinton Cripple Chip, National smart ID cards,\nit all boils down to PEOPLE CONTROL.  Can you say 1984, only 10 years late?\nI knew you could...  :-)\n\n<laws, they would have been released as they had been before.  If this\n<had happened and it turned out that the BATF had used too much force,\n<then the BDs would have grounds for a law suit and for federal charges\n<of civil rights violations (Sounds a lot like LA, huh?  Don't take that\n<wrong, I'm not commenting one way or the other about the Rodney King\n<case).  But that's not what they wanted.  They got tipped off that the\n<BATF was on the way in, and rather than adopting a non-violent,\n<non-threatening posture to greet the BATF, they decided to fight.\n\nAnd BATF knew the BDs were expecting them (via 60 minutes report).  But\nthey decided they were so big, so bad, they would have a cakewalk at\nthe BDs expense, for a nice media show anyway.  But it all turned to\nshit, and the FBI taking over to manage things, we see it all turned to\nshit, too.  Clinton says 'I am taking full responsibility'...  BAH.\nResponsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong.  Bet\nyou NOBODY pays any serious repercussions.  'Responsibility' only has\nmeaning as media PR, or as a means to corner the average Joe Schmoe.\nFigure it out...

On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was \nabout 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand\nprimers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20\nand .308.  The fire was extinguished before the area containing the \nreloading supplies were fully involved.  There was about 1/2\" of char on\nthe joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting.  Lots of heat in other\nwords.\n\nNone of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited.\nNo explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do.\nThe black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids\ncompletely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder was\ncontained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charred\nbadly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case\nof the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away.\n\nMany of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood\non all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the\nrifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were\nfound still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into \nthe wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually\ndislodge them.

You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief\njust as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone who\ndoesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and\ntherefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what the\ngovernment says is wrong to be wrong.\n\nDavid Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists,\nmethodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT\neven though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe\nthe same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid\nto mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment.\nYou see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others\nfit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned \nfrom it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice\njust isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I go\nmy own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else,\neither individually or collectively as the great socialist \"we\" has ANY \nRIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong.\n\nYou seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to\njust forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound\nin order to \"save themselves\".  Think (if you're capable) for a moment\nabout some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if\nsuddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are\nbeneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear\nenough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct\ncourse of action for your government to initiate actions specifically\ndesigned to force you to make that \"forsake or die\" decision?\n\nThe \"forsake or die\" option is exactly what the government forced on the\nDavidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that\nfirst shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51\nwhen they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and\nchildren holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The\npeople who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose\nindividual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who\nbelieved that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those\npeople go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.  People like\nyou who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with \"well they could\nhave come out\" get my most scornful contempt.  I'd spit in your face\nwere there not a network between us.

The squad was\nslowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some students\nwere taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two\nstudents who were following and taunting.\n\nThe series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while\noccasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from.\nAll at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1\nGarands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this\n45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with\nthe taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in\nthe confrontation.\n\nThere is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently\nthey had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had\nconveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio,\nJames Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known\nthat he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in.\n\nThe matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later, wounded survivors launched\na civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the\nterms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not\nidentified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified).\n\nIt was a tragic incident, but it was not provoked by the students, or apparently\nby General DelCorso or any of his command.  From studying the incident & the \nphotos, IMO it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers."

For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas\ninto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a\nfortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because\nit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't\nthey do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or\nsimilar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been\nsaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.\n\nHere's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some\ntime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that\nthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I\ndon't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this\nso-called \"explosion\" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.\nWe figure that this is what it was because of how the \"explosion\"\nlooked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,\ndynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion\nin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something\nthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.\n\nIsn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four\nofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that\nsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown\nby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about\nwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they\nsaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE\nTHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?\nPerhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the\ncause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.\n\nWhat is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the\ncompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade\nbody during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on\nthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a\nspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this\ngrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only\npeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be\na shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,\nor explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their\nface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the\nrubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the\nATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to\nmake sure that others \"find\" what they want for them to \"find\" if\nyou know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here\nbut if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks\nhad gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.\nAlso recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents\nused grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot\n\nBefore:  \"David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets\n          the Bible through the barrel of a gun...\"  --ATF spokesman\nAfter:   \"[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets\n          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun...\"  --Me"

After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.\ntype folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,\nand surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.\nThe Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student\n(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...\n\n(The title was the only thing they changed/added)\n\n\"Gun Stats\"\n\nThe Daily recently reprinted an article from the\nWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton\nQuigley, author of \"Armed and Female.\"  The article,\nin turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally\nreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The\narticle states, \"A study... found that a gun in the home\nwas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,\nspouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.\"  This\nis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-\neral reasons, outlined below:\n\nThe study gives the impression that, if you own a\ngun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to\ndefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned\nagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take into\naccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun\nto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-\ntrator.\n\nThe study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather\nthan 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\nfriend.\n\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample\nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\n\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be\nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an\naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a\ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies\nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\nused to commit suicide.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can\nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has\nto consider carefully what questions were asked by\nthose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-\nrate conclusion from them.\n\nD.F.

Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it\nis when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding\nthe pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported\nby the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While\nthis may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not\npropel the bullet with any significant velocity.\n\nIn fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded\ncartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough\nto take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe.\n\nThus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause\nslight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.\n\n                               -- Alane --\n   /-----------------------------------------------------------------\\\n  /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    \"I am a jelly doughnut\"      \\\n /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \\\n/-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\"

Sounds a bit\n>>tacky, but hey, whatever works.\n\nAs David Veal points out, this sort of \"promotion\" would be used\nagainst gun owners by the mass media.\n\nHowever, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,\nfree, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40\nor $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.\n\nOur Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished\nteaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been\nvery well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices\ninterested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but\nfeel they should know something about \"gun safety\" since members\nof their family keep guns at home.\n\nTeaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:\n\n(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases\n    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.\n\n(2) A \"gun safety\" class is Politically Correct, and likely to\n    be viewed positively by the public and the media.\n\n(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)\n    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a\n    gentle introduction to firearms.\n\n(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun\n    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.\n\n(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners\n    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,\n    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate\n    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun\n    students sometimes tell us they have \"something new to think\n    about\" with regards to personal gun ownership.\n\n(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.\n\nOur course is the standard NRA-certified \"Home Firearm Safety\"\nclass, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also\nteach the NRA's \"Personal Protection\" class, although the cost\nis higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.\n\nI think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to\ngun buy-backs.\n\n                               -- Alane --\n   /-----------------------------------------------------------------\\\n  /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    \"I am a jelly doughnut\"      \\\n /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \\\n/-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\"

At least four federal agents and two cult members\n    were reported killed.  [...]\n\n    The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock\n    trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning,\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and\n    explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in\n    Washington.  [...]\n\n    Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,\n    throwing concussion grenades and screaming \"Come out,\" while three\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no\n    response.  Then the shooting began. \n\nI think \"storming the sect's head-quaters\" and \"throwing concussion\ngrenades\" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).\n\n> he was not just another guy minding his own business.

A\nfairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We\nall believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have\nfirearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding\nupon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to\ndo it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with\na philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting\nthe many?

You might remember how a\nChamberlain \"gave a little\" to a particular fascist/short asshole,\nand how such \"appeasement\" worked.

I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be\nwilling to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,\ncars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the\narguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more\npeople than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict\ncars than it does guns.

As\nDesert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even\nwhen given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did\nwith an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first\nacts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show\nthat dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.\nThus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown\nor if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.\nOne can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.\n\n>Is this discussion about\n>1.

Oh, okay Charles,\nthat makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart\nFoundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational\nand that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES\nof death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation\nand diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes.\nPlease, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.\n \nI've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents\ngroup or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don't\nconfuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many\nvictims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don't agree.\nI'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of\nchildhood deaths.

The statement that you responded to above is actually\nin reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed\nconcern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane\nperson and Rational person could be interchangeable huh?

But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, \"Firearm murders\nof youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990\"\n \nIs the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state\nthat \"Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun\naccidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded\".\n \nOr how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say \"Gunshot\nwounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas\nbetween 1987 and 1990.\"\n \nDo you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state\nthat \"Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from\n1986 to 1988.\"\n \nCharles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly\nvictims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't\nrealize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go\ninto the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll\nby yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.

In the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump\ninto a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1\nsentence that you decide to respond to. What the hell are you saying here???\nYou're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control\nissue out of a discussion that isn't.\n>\n>> The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that\n>> 400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.\n>\n>I wouldn't trust their statistics without *independent* verification.\n>\n>> The CDC estimates\n>> that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once\n>> in 1990.\n>\n>Based on CPHV statistics?

As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact\nwith many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local\nurban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.

Ask them if they have ever heard\ngunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot,\nwhether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and\nwhether they themselves have ever been shot.\n \nBelieve me Charles, THAT will be your *INDEPENDENT* VERIFICATION.\n \n###########################################################################\nRodney W.

All homicides must be shown, per capita, not  \n: just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  \n: murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  \n: favorite.\n\nAs a \"favorite\", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in\nChicago produced this table:\n\n\t\tPercentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks\n\t\t\t    Resulting in Death\n\t\t\t    \n\tWeapon\t\t\t\tDeaths As Percentage of Attacks\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------\n\tKnives (16,518 total attacks)\t\t 2.4\n\tGuns (6,350 total attacks)\t\t12.2\n\n\tSource: Firearms and Violence in American Life\n\t\nIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns\nthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\n\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\n\n\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\n\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\n\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\ndon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\n\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\n\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\n\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\nstandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.\n\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\n\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\n\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\nin Vancouver.\n\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\nearlier findings.\n\n-------\n\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\ninterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\n\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\nSeattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\nself-defense.\n\n\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\n\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\n\n\tJohn H.

NRA Official Journal 1/89.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear sir:\n\nBy now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication\nof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are\ndrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of \nmomentus \"scientific\" findings. These are regularly released to the press\nwithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and\noften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.\nGenerally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however\nmeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle\nserious studies by criminologists.\n\nThe latest effort -- \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:\nA Tale of Two Cities,\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying \neditorial, \"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\" by two employees\nof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult\nto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few\ndata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length\nto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular\norder.\n\n\t1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to \n\tsupport the statement that \"some have argued that restricting\n\taccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate\n\tof homicide.\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that\n\tcontention.\n\t\n\t2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very\n\tsimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,\n\tdemographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities\n\tare very different with very different demographic characteristics\n\twhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in\n\tSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white\n\tand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be\n\tthe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-\n\tgrounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various\n\tethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.\n\t\n\t3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,\n\tcompared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all\n\tthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect\n\tin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-\n\t1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth\n\tinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM\n\tarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving\n\thandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that\n\tone must look to see the prior situation was before concluding\n\tthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that\n\ta patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day\n\tfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without\n\tat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?\n\t\n\t4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national\n\tgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily\n\tselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because\n\tit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific\n\treason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which\n\tinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \"control\"?\n\tHad different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite\n\t\"scientific\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide\n\trate *exceeds* that of such \"wild west\" cities in Texas as\n\tEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado\n\tSprings. (Ref. 3)\n\t\n\t5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or\n\thandguns \"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in\n\tVancouver.\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending\n\tto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is\n\tan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry\n\tpermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in\n\tVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of\n\thandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun\n\towners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number\n\tof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns\n\tfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns\n\tlegally for protection, registration figures are\n\tmeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York\n\tCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,\n\tthat method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population\n\tin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver\n\thas a greater \"prevalence of weapons\" than New York City.\n\t\n\tThe second method of measuring gun density is \"Cook's gun\n\tprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity\n\tdifferences.\" But the validation was by Cook of his own\n\ttheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a\n\tdifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is\n\tbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement\n\tin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking\n\ta measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide\n\t(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in\n\thomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in\n\tVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-\n\tability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and\n\tVancouver.\n\t\n\t6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and\n\tCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that\n\tWashington has a waiting period and background check prior to\n\tthe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian\n\tlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personal\n\tprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is more\n\tdifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually\n\tthe case.\n\t\n\t7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain\n\tthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the\n\tpenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of \n\tclearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a\n\tfirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number\n\tof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making\n\tarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest\n\trates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences\n\timposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,\n\tor gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social\n\tscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,\n\tthe authors of the NEJM \"tale of two cities\" fail even to mention\n\tmost factors related to crime control.\n\t\n\t8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective\n\tmeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not\n\tthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost\n\t650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from\n\tcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the\n\tliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be\n\tcompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury\n\tto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors\n\treported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides\n\twithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle\n\taccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides\n\tinvolving firearms.\n\t\n\t9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \"study,\"\n\teditorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \"applied\n\tscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb\n\tadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly\n\thandguns.\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly\n\tbe mistaken for \"scientific methods\" by a sociologists or\n\tcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \"study\" is the equivolent\n\tof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding\n\ttwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25\n\tand the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,\n\tadministering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while\n\tgiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure\n\tand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, \n\tannouncing in a \"special article\" a new medical breakthrough.\n\tIt would be nice to think that such a \"study\" would neither be\n\tfunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.\n\t\n\tSince the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC\n\tmake them willing to present shoddy research as \"scientific\n\tbreakthroughs\" in \"special articles\" and editorials relating\n\tto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying\n\tthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversight\n\tover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about\n\tthe distortions contained in \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,\n\tand Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"Firearm Injuries: A Call\n\tfor Science.\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside\n\twhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize\n\tan opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tREFERENCES\n\n1.

Wright\n          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)\n\n      Someone once wrote: \"Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is\n   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\"  The problem is demonstrated\n   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting\n   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by\n   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal\n   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and\n   suggested that a handgun ban \"may reduce the rate of homicide in a \n   community.\"\n      The nine medical doctors who published \"Handgun Regulations, Crime,\n   Assaults, and Homicide\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite\n   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver\n   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations\n   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems\n   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period\n   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.\n   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,\n   Why?\n      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case\n   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,\n   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their\n   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and \n   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point\n   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support\n   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody\n   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We\n   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that\n   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates\n   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.\n      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two\n   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-\n   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons\n   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the\n   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.\n*     The second bit of evidence is \"Cook's gun prevalence index,\" which stands\n*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index\n*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in \n*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage\n*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.\n*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,\n*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take\n*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be\n*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides\n*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general \n*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To\n*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \"prove\" it on the basis of\n*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.\n      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that\n   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.\n   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun\n   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates\n   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,\n   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.\n      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of\n   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the \n   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin \n   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime\n   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke\n   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.\n      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data\n   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \"similar in\n   many ways,\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law\n   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish\n   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \"all\n   else is equal\" among things being compared.\n*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look \n*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime\n*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage\n*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle\n*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.\n*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the\n*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-\n*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown\n*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.\n*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is\n*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates\n*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide\n*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.\n*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due\n*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,\n*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics\n*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison\n*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial\n*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle\n*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain\n*  in either city.\n      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the\n   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority \n   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \"gun availability\"\n   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not\n   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why\n   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed\n   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,\n   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)\n      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between\n   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have \n   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol \n   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city\n   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the \n   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the\n   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian\n   percentage?\n      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many\n   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent\n   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \"many ways\" might explain part\n   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such\n   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.\n*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide\n*  result in a \"complex picture.\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing\n*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They\n*  also acknowledge that \"socio-economic status is probably an important\n*  confounding factor in our comparison,\" remarking further that \"blacks   \n*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of\n*  Vancouver's population.\"  Given the evidence presented in the article,\n*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle\n*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial\n*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,\n*  since \"detailed information about household incomes according to race\n*  is not available for Vancouver.\"\n      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in \n   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple\n   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms\n   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one \n   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.\n   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce \n   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into\n   account?  In this example, the \"hidden variable\" is city size: Guns are\n   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city\n   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the\n   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very\n   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities\n   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,\n   and their results are impossible to interpret.\n      In the editorial \"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\" accompanying\n   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the\n   authors for applying \"scientific methods\" to a problem of grave public\n   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from\n   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate\n   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them\n   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are\n   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this\n   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical\n   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--\n   is cause for further concern.\n\n   [James D.

Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the\nthreat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger\nusing a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim \nin an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not\nbe as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually\n_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)\nIt isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a\nknife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more\ncommon. That's why it is important to look at the overall\n(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of\nsubstitution, different criminal techinques of using different\nweapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.\n\n>As for knives, see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife\n>than a gun, thanks.  \n\n\"Face\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't\ntoo common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the\nusual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts\nto much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your\npockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun\nthan actually stabbed with a knife.\n\n>...Fortunately, the best defense against a knife isn't\n>another knife.  Anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have\n>much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife\n>assault (which probably means 99.9% of knife assailants).\n\nActually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in\nunarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman \nwithout much problem.\n\nYou also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime\nSurvey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a\nknife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives\nin a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost\nall prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,\nusing (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)\na weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless\nof how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective\nthan guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a \"serious threat\"\nnearly as often as they do guns.\n\n                                              Frank Crary\n                                              CU Boulder"

But\nthere would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to \nconsider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with \nfireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000\n(National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes\neach year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find\nthe number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are\nhomicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately\n5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides\nand fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to \nbe any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures\nwould disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns.\nThat would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF,\nonly 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since\ngun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal\nsales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,\nlaw-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on\narmed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) \nThat doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.\n  \n>...There were over 250 >accidental< handgun\n>homicides in America in 1990, most with licensed weapons.\n\nSince most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not\nsupporting \"reasonable\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background\nchecks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would \nalter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you\nare supporting.\n\nBy the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.\n250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to \nother household accidents.\n\n>...More\n>American children accidentally shot other children last year (15)\n>than all the handgun homicides in Great Britain.\n\n1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from \ndrinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from\nfalls.

Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing\naround on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to \npay someone anyway.

It's homicide rate is almost ten\ntimes the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.\nresident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and\nbuy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs\nand make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban \ncan not be easily side-stepped.\n\n> >To show why the tools argument is the silliest i have ever seen.. take an\n> >analogy from computer science... almost every computer science major\n> >can write a \"wordprocessor\" yet we(comp sci majors)  would willingly pay 3  \n> >to 400 bucks for a professional software like wordperfect... why don't we  \n> >just all write our own software???......

The only real problems are a ~25% reduction\nin energy (so a .357 magnum would \"only\" be as deadly as a 9mm)\nand it makes alot more smoke...

What do you think 75% of you is?\n\nBut whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the\nneutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water\nturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would \nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\n\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\nis clearly appropriate.\n\n>>  Plus these things have no self-\n>>defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as\n>>a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use\n>>(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration\n>>(translation:  cities and population centers).\n\n>\tIf the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal\n>government, they are indeed useful weapons to the militia.\n\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\nfor that.\n\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\n\n                                                  Frank Crary\n                                                  CU Boulder"

When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  \n\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll \nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \nwith your note.  \n\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn't \nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \n\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn't \nsupport the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions \nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \n\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \n\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \nclearly indicate the contrary.  \n\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \n\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \ncriminal offense.  \n\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \nwouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's \npermission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \nBefore the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \nineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in \nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \nand their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\n\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \naware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what \ntheir real motives are.  \n\nLook:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \nit's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\n\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \nprovides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I \nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \n-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can \nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \n\nSo what's the point?  \n\nL.

        "content": "I wrote :\n  Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were\ntanks\n  used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired\ntheir\n  main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is\n  ludicrous.\n\nAwesley replied:\n     I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,\n  supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.\n\nThe issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It\nhas been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that\ntanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\nsniper fire and that they were \"quite\" effective at this.  You continue to\nback away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\ndisputing.\n\nAwesley went on:\n  I\n  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was\n  down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10\n  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's\n  Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of\n  Tonia Blanding, age 4.\n   \n        \"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction\n  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the\n  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front\n  of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out\n  of the side of the apartment.\"\n  \n       Well, it's not the main gun.  \n\n\"Well, it's not the main gun.\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\nnow going to admit that you were wrong?\n\nI wrote:\n  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main\n  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I\nread\n  the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. \n  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard\n  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American\n  cities in the Sixties.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to\n  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main\n  guns.\n\nI will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\nriots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\nwithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\nmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\nbeen *big* news.\n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nTo fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\ngrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\nperfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\nit makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nAnd on:\n  I don't\n  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and\nactually\n  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know\n  what you find.\n\nI already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used\nF-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you\nbelieve me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research\nit?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?\n\nIf tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\nscreaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\nit.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \nIf your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\nto live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\nthose tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\n--John L. Scott"

The University cops here (who are\n>are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most\n>state cops are.\n\nDefine \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\n\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\n\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\n  the trigger again.\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n  to rotate to the next round.\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n  easy motion, even one handed.\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it's jammed!\" before starting to do anything\n  about clearing it.\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\n  of employment as a revolver.\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\nas the timer on a VCR.\n\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\nthe police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\n\nGun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a \nwonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.\nGood controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.\nI own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon\nto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit\nwhat I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously\nwrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those\nextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in\ncriminal encounters is less than 5.\n\nWhat do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple\n.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police \nprefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....\n\nObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they \n        introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking\n        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.\n\n-- \n\"If everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect.\"\n\t-BATF spokesperson on CNN 3/2/93, regarding failed raid attempt in TX."

I never said that these\n\talternative means of self-protection involved any hardware.\n\tWhy are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because every\n\tperson is armed to the teeth. It is because of (1) attitude\n\tand (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents\n\tmake themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when\n\tstrangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups\n\tlike 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative\n\teffectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the\n\tgood neighbors step up and say \"THAT'S the one officer ! He\n\twas robbing Mr. Jones' house\". \n\n\tIn short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at\n\tleast a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.\n\tReplace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better\n\tconversationalist too and you can invite it over for a\n\tblock party. \n\n>>> Freedoms and rights are not dependent on public opinion, necessity, or\n>>> scientific scrutiny.\n>>\n>>\tNew to this planet ?

They certainly have the right to do so, under\nthe Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.\n\nIf you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to\nrun legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your\ndispleasure over their censorship doctrine.\n\nFollowing is a list of Bay area newspapers who censor gun ads.

Every\n|day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming in.  The majority that I\n|see are still carrying revolvers.  Not that there is anything wrong with a\n|revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple\n|of automatics in his coat (I mean semi-auto handguns) you're going to be at a\n|disadvantage even with training.  I have been at a shooting range where gang\n|gang members were \"practicing\" shooting.  They were actually practicing\n|taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target\n|and they weren't doing too badly either.   The University cops here (who are\n|are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most\n|state cops are.  I don't know where you are originally from David but you live\n|in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news\n|and in the papers.  I think the situation is just a tad different here\n|than there.\n\nHowever, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about\nanything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for\ncarry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka,\nwho happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun\npolice chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).\n\nPerhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to-\n100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable\nautomatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto\nhandgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.\n\nI don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make\non the order of at least $40K/year. \n\nYour presumption of \"disadvantage\" I think is not borne out by the\nexperiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out\non top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.\n\nI've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers\ncarried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; others\nhave seen Browning Hi-Powers...\n\n|Jason"

You still haven't offered\n\nI've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I'd rather face a knife than\na gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\nsame thing, then I got 'educated.'\n\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\n(within a minute or so) death.\n\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\n'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\nonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\n\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\nability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\nstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\nslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\nthe attacker.\n\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\nknife attacks in prison.\n\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\ncast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike\nin 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\nseconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\npointed end.)\n\nAdd to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\nseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'\n\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\n\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\nattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\ncaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually\ndo this.\n\nRemember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\n'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\nus alive.\n\nI don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now\nknow, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would\nhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I\nWOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not\nfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen\nbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do\nwhatever it takes.\n\nRick."

What this means is the damned\nthing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just\nabout (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is\nfunctioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working\ncorrectly is totally drop safe.\n\nNow, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single\ndocumented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because\nhe failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few\ndocumented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't\nfigure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the\nproprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely\nprevented the office from getting shot.\n\nThe purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.\nThis does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down\nintentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a\n'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the\nstandpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.\nBy this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.\nFrom the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a\nrevolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of\nfiring it.\n\nThe ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that\nthe firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the\nwide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be\nfamiliar with that particular type of firearm.\n\nRick."

I'd rather have the extra round.\n\n> - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n>   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\nQuite true.

The 80 series Colt's for\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\n\n> - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n>   operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nAgreed.\n\nNow that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On\nthe other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\nyears.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\n\nI've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\n\nMost revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\ninto that category.\n\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \"The Semi\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\n\nIn general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\n\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\nisn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.\n\nFor myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\n\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\ntoo!)\n\nIf this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)\n\nRick."

The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems\nlike heart attack and stroke.\n\n'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans\nusing firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some\nmay have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in \nusing firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.\n(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, \nbut many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage\nif anything is low.)\n\nAt any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred \nto as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group \ncan be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might \nsupport a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.\n\nCertainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half\nof your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.  \n\n>\t                               Besides, there are other\n>\tmeans of self-protection which can be just as effective\n>\tas firearms. \n\nPlease provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might \nconvince your local police departments to switch.  Good luck.\n\nRick."

Down that road lies\ntotal government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.\n\n>Guns 'n Criminals:\n>MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.\n\n       This is very likely.\n\n>Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.\n>And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),\n>we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.\n\n       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many\npeople would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\nheavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.\n\n>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:\n>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!\n\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide\nrates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\nhalf the per-car death rate.\n\n>The issue (I hope..):\n>I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.\n>Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is....

The\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\nirrelevent.\n\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\n\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\n\n>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them\n>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,\n>it's the 'axer' ??\n>(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)\n\n\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got\nmore knives or fists.  \n\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\nare doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is \nviolent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\nyou can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\n\n>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect\n>themselves. Is this a good situation ?? \n\n       The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives.\nBut recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,\nprotecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,\ntoo, lost their livelihoods?\n\n>Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??\n\n       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.\nHowever, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can\nbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\nwon't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\n\n       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If\nyou're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\nsimply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\n\n>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have\n>guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)\n\n       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.\nThat accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.\nFirearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the\ngroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.\n\n       You may take that for what it's worth.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \"snipers\"\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\n\nI don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\nIts the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\ngovernment going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\n\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\ngunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".  I think it could be\ndone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is\nnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning\nand firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible\nto cover up.\n\n>--John L.

        "content": "Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\n\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.\n\nFriday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.\n\nSynopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent\nCooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald\nHowen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\n\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\nthe government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\"\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \"If\nyou're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I'm not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals.\"\n\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we'll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \nSpence continued, \"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can't have a fair trial if the\njury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm\nviolating court orders.\"\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\n\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled\nis the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton."

I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about\nthe Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).\n\n1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?\n     What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're \"in committee\".\n     How close is that to being made law?\n\n2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important\n   differences I missed?\n\n3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:\n  A. S414 doesn't specify an \"appeals\" process to wrongful denial during\n     the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals\n     process once the required instant background check system is established,\n     but not before).\n  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving\n     using existing records (so who would I sue in \"A\" above to have an\n     inaccurate record corrected?)\n  C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person\n     can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an\n     immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.\n     But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a \"threat\", nor does\n     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception\n     statement.\nTrue?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?\n\n4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a \"clean\" record from\n   buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?\n   At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?\n\n   'Seems at min. a \"gun counting\" scheme would be needed\n   (e.g., \"John Doe owns N guns\").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised\n   to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun\n   registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.\n\nPlease comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current\nlegislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits\nof any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.\n\n\tMarkS || shepard@netcom.com"

Find another way.\n\nYou know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straighten\nthings out in this country.  Also, people would have a need to replace\nguns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OC\nseem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal.\n\nGuns are really \"old\" in design and as long as we have tons of them, no one\nis motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up with\nsome real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would get\nus moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want, right?  Stuff\nthat's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.\n\nRemember, in this country we'll really scramble to accomplish impossible\nfeats if we are motivated enough and I think \"self-defense\" is high on our\nlist of motivators."

It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get\n   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I\n   was told by a police officer.\n2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to\n   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns\n   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.\n3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will\n   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.\n   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form\n   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  \n   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these\n   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will\n   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess\n   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.\n4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will\n   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations\n   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some \n   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.\n   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)\n\nThis covers most of what we discussed.

They \nsupport spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum\nwho have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society\nor its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun\ncontrol (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun\ncontrol (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they\nhave to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront\nthe fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that\nare causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't\naccept that!

Alas, this is not provable. I think that that\n> there are actually *few* cases where this is so. \n\nexcerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago:\n\n     Although less apparent to those who have not researched\nthe facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  as\nsport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recent\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\npolice.\"2\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\nrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,\nthe completion rate drops to 3%.\n \n1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine\nde Gruyter, NY, 1991\n2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A\nSurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,\n1986\n-------\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a \nlarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to\nsemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand\nhim and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is\nvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something \nlike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that\n\"different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in \nmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a\ncertain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to \nlearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar\nwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least\nslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.\n\n|> \n|> Define \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\n|> Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\n|> faster rate of fire is usually not desirable.

With a single hand you either\npull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi\nauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.\n\n\n|> - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n|>   to rotate to the next round.\n\nI'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA\nsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same\nround - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will\nalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud\nbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will\nnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide\non a misfire takes very little time.\n\n\n|> - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n|>   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n|>   easy motion, even one handed.\n\nActually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not\nnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and\nat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the\nround to set it off.\n\n|> - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n|>   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\nThe best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed\nloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two\nhanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that\nwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the\ngun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always \ntake more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing\na partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can\nstill be used if needed later).  \n\n|> \n|> - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n|>   first, time spent which can be fatal.

Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire\nwith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto\nbut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).\n\n\n|> - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n|>   and cock the hammer.

While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should\nsay that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's\nno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing\npin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage\ncarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed\nof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm\nnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was\ninitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining\nthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and \nshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in\na thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets\nyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.\n\n|> \n|> Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\n|> switching many officers back to the old revolvers.

I imagine that if all\nyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger\nfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that\nnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and\nrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew\noff your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.\n\n|> \n|> Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\n|> the police don't know nothing about firearms.

I understand that\nthey are only intended to be discouragers, ie. for the snapping but not truly\ndangerous animal.  In general, they do not seem capable of really stopping\nsomeone who wants you or past you.  They are fired at very low muzzle velocity\n(the .38 ball round is intended for a 400fps load).

Either you don't read very well or resort\nto falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.\n\nAt the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was\nthe chain was regarding the tanks \"last used in Detroit in 48\".\nThe text follows.\n\n:  You did not merely claim that\n: tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\n: sniper fire and that they were \"quite\" effective at this.  \n\nIndeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say\nI had been told they did fire their main guns.  \n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n: You continue to\n: back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\n: disputing.\n\nWell, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks\npost-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  \n\n: \"Well, it's not the main gun.\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\n: now going to admit that you were wrong?\n\nThat was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?\n   --------------------------------------------------\n  \"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\nto respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"\n   --------------------------------------------------\n\n  I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're\npaying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\neyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\npeople judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n\"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n\n  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:\n  --------------------------------------------------\n>We haven't used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948. \n\nCorrection.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it\nwas well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions\nit in his song \"Black Day in July\".\n  --------------------------------------------------\n\n  Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that\nmeans I was right.  \n\n: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\n: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\n: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\n: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\n: been *big* news.\n\n   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  \n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\n: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\n: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nJohn, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you\nhave to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\nnothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\nneed some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a\nwhile.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. \n\n: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n: it. \n\n   Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\nauthority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\nhad happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\nauthority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\nmassive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\nSome claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\nthe Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also\nheard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\nassert that I claimed they were truth.\n\n: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\n   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \ndifference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \nyears ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\nSo it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\n   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\nwere burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\nam inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\n: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\n: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\n   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\nthat they did fire their guns.\n\n   Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\nthis far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\naccount I cited.\n\n: --John L.

In fact, it is often\nchosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does\nbasically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the\nfact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less\ntraining time required. \n\n\tSmith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht\nthey do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which\nif properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun\nfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and\nwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various \ngun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little\ntest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked\npeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and\nshoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times\nwere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or\nthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.\n\n\tYou don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger\nwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing\ncity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..\n\n\tOf course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but\nsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I\nknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off\nchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that\n'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time\nto draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.\n\n\tDon't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks\nin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,\nit was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the\noperator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I\ndon't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.\n\n\tAs per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree\n100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  \n\n-Just my $.02 + tax\n-------   Steve Syck        syck5280@miller.cs.uwm.edu        --------"

What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals\ncontain a sort of \"gotcha\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even\nif you qualify in every way.\n\n>Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun\n>-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.\n>It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???\n>You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...\n\n       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general\na driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its\nEuropean counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult\nthere than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. \n\n       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different\nthings.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit\nto operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary\nto own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the\nability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise\nfrom the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations\nfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,\nwhich is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get\npast legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public\nproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              \n\n>Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):\n>Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'\n>for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.\n>Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \n>time befor the crime.\n>\n>Use of knives:\n>It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.\n>You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\n>in public -rigth ??\n\n        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have\na difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,\nwhere the laws from one state to another can be as radically different\nas from one country in Europe to another).\n\n        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow\nconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can\nbe either a state or local restriciton.       \n\n>Individual vs masses:\n>Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some\n>extent....\n>Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??\n>What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of \n>all the others ??\n\n       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual\naffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually\nget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within\nthis group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting \nthe rights of some other group.  \n\n       If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you'd\nhave a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase\nsome person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own\nguns\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told\nthat their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's\nrights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited\nby one.\n\n>The issue:\n>I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.\n\n       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to\nwhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.\n\n>We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\n>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\n>But should it have to be like that ??\n\n       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that\nother people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.\nBut currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.\n\n>Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\n\n       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state\nmay enforce it's \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise\nconcept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be\n\"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.\n   \n>If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think\n>it should be free to buy guns ??\n\n       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently\nimplemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue\ngeneration for the State and ignored by a startling number of\ndrivers.

        "content": "UPI Washington DC, Update Desk\t\t\t4/15/93\n\n  For the past several months the Clinton administration has been\n  stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most\n  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the \n  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area\n  of jobs creation.\n\n  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,\n  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed\n  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting\n  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.\n\n  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.\n  \"It's the guns\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other\n  \"gun-nuts\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the\n  economy out of the recession.  \"Their buying them five times faster than\n  ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.  \n\n  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have\n  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several\n  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have\n  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.\n\n  \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said\n  the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we\n  suspect it will\", he added.\n\n  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new\n  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's \n  called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,\n  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index \n  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw\n  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any\n  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the\n  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.\n\n  The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the\n  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run\n  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,\n  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the\n  street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee\n  this program, citing her \"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject\n  of gun control\".\n\n  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an\n  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing\n  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \"Their stockpiling,\n  stockpiling, stockpiling\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference\n  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.\n\n  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment\n  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been\n  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \"First we'll\n  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning\", during a press\n  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate\n  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow\n  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require\n  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,\n  after all of the cards have been drawn.\n\n  The head of the BATF responded by saying, \"We will have to see if this\n  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those\n  guns\".\n\n  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado\n  declared this proposed law as being \"reasonable gun control which won't\n  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\".\n\n  - end article -\n\n  For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-) \n\n                                Bill Vojak\n                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.com\n\t\t\t\tNRA, ILA,\n                                Colorado Firearms Coalition\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

Before\nyou can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club.\nWell, how active can you be without a gun, chief?\n\nMost gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental\ndisorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the\ngovernment.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some\ntrapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you\nare perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.\n\n> It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???\n> You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...\n\nSince the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US \nis around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun\nowners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.\n\nBesides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There\nare about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but\nonly 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot\nof energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.\n\nJust like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring\nsafety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But \nthey already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't \nfund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence \nto those with political connections.  Is this fair?\n\n> Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \n> time befor the crime.\n\nAnd how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets?\nHow many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?\n\n> Use of knives:\n> It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.\n> You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\n> in public -rigth ??\n\nSome states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry.\nSome allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed \ncarry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage\nover another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good,\nthen state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing.\nWhich means that they really don't have any objective reasons for \nthese laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.\n\n> Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive':\n> We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide\n> to take action we DO.\n\n(\"Hot-livered.\"  I LOVE that expression.

The rest of our criminals\naffect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this\nduring the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts\nNO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that\nthe crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to\npossess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens\nwho have lived good lives as if they were just \"pre-felons\" waiting to\ncommit crimes.\n\n> We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\n\nI don't understand this sentence.\n\n> IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\n> But should it have to be like that ??\n\nLife isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or\nflood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car.\nBut pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have\nto do to live in this one.\n\n> Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\n\nNone of ours, I'm sure.\n\n> If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think\n> it should be free to buy guns ??\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone,\neither.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who \ndrive drunk, drive without it!\n\nHowever, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life.\nI rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.\n\n> I'm not a pacifist or anti gun. \n> I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns as\n> neccities or toys.\n> I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn't\n> want to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....\n\nThe question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's\nwhether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do.\nI don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun.\nI do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning\none, too.\n-- \n\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet..."

        "content": "[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]\n\nGun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day\nwith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.\nIt was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,\nwhereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from\nwherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.\n\nMike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\n\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\nmany cases, who they were).\n\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\ndiscuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a\ndelegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\n\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\ninadequate hearing room.\n\nOne of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\n\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\"\n\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\npro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\nseveral Simon's Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\n\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\n\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\nto \"support GOAL's position\" on \"all bills.\"\n\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \n\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\n\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.\n\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\"\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't\nbe having this situation -- but they won't.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\n\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O'Neill.  He was\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\njudge, he'd give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\n\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\n\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\nconvicted.\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.\n\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\ncongressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that\nit's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\n\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\nJujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\nyear it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\nIt's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\nmore effective.\n\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\n\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\n\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\nrambling circumlocution in response.\n\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\n\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\n\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver's license was a\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I'll make you a deal.  You get\nme the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\"\n\nNext came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\nwouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\n\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\nFID's,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\nout-of-staters completely off?)\n\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\nrecord.\n\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\n\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\"\n\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\nGOAL's position) were:\n\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\n\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\n\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\n   opposed)\n\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \n   (opposed)\n\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\n\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\n\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\n\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\n\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\n\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\n\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\n\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\nAgain, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\n\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\nended at about 6:30.\n-- \n\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet..."

I really doubt all of those\noccur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of \"self-inflicted\ngunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters\" is probably\nwell under 250 per year.\n\n>>If you fall, for example,\n>> and land on the handgun or cause a sudden blow, the gun will discharge.\n\nHandguns designs have included a \"hammer block\" since around 1960\nor earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates\nthe cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun\ncannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and\nis pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result,\nmodern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or \nin some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.) \n\n>> The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of\n>> deaths caused by animal attacks or \"wacko\" attacks combined.\n\nI don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders \neach year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest.

Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the\nTreasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities\nwere aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-\ngally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to\nbe used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently\nmade great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-\ntation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before\nBATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence\nwas submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF\ngun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither\ncriminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into\nunknowning technical violations.\n \n( Exerpt from: 97th Congress; 2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT\n     T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S\n                                REPORT\n                                of the\n                   SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION\n                                of the\n                      COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n                         UNITED STATES SENATE\n                        NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\n                            SECOND SESSION\n                             FEBRUARY, 1982\n        Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\n88-618 O\n                        WASHINGTON : 1982\n \n \nLetter to Constituent: April 1993\n \n \nThank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nand Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with\njurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.\n \nIt has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations\nSubcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which\nfunds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly\nprofessional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.\nThe agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in\nsuccessful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use\nof firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It\nenforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory\nminimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an\nillegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in\npreventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk\nyouth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known\ngangs from access to weapons.\n \nThe Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF\non the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession\n(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs\nand other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to\ntrace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where\nthey keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF\nis the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with\nstate and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state\nand local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office\nfelt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally\nestablish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and\nthorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members\nof the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a\nSunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would\nbe separated from the women and children and not in the area where\nit was known that the illegal weapons were stored.\n \nAs you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh\nspiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending\nexecution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the\nelement of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and\nprepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation\npresented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the\nFBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military\ntanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and\nfirepower of the Branch Davidians.\n \nBased on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian\nraid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply\nsaddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who\nattempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the\ncult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a\nthorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside\nthe Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for\nEnforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the\nWaco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the\nevaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick\nand peaceful conclusion.\n \nSincerely,\n \nDennis DeConcini\nChairman\nSubcommittee on Treasury,\nPostal Service and\nGeneral Government\n \nApril 7, 1993\n \n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com"

Notwithstanding the military\n    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are\n    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments\n    are afraid to trust the people with arms.\"\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: \"The right\n    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A\n    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,\n                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free\n    country...\"\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of\n    the militia): \"Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n    a year.\"\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing\n    armies): \"... if circumstances should at any time oblige the\n    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be\n    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large\n    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their\n                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****\n    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.\"\n    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBut *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they\nsaid \"people\", right?

That's why the Right is reserved to the People.

I consider 5' a reasonable space\nlimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to\nthose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at\nwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the\nendangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility\nof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and\ndraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\n\n>They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to\n>protect their homes and families.

I assume that word\nwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this\nis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change\nquite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.

With such low\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\n\n>I think it is vital to avoid such a situation, where a small \n>minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power\n>through violence.

Since the expense of a tank is so large,\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\n\n>Here, I think we have to be carefull about _which_ \"state\" we\n>are talking about: Certainly one role of the militia is to\n>overthrow a repressive government, and it would be completely\n>destructive to that end for that same government to control \n>the militia's arms.

The State having control\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\n\n>That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select\n>militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly-trained\n>specialists.

Just as you argued above that\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\nso one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\n\n>Consider, then, the effect of removing the National Guard's\n>infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local\n>governments.

These would be much more useful to infantry than the\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\nI suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\n\n>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds\n>>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and\n>>the like.\n>\n>I would much rather see these things handled by the local, \n>general militias.\n\n\tSo would I, but the resources often aren't available to\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\nthan anything else.\n\n>Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of\n>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to \n>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry\n>arm of the regular army.\n\n\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\ntrucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\n\n\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\nother responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\nfor these functions.\n\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

It is my opinion that most educated\nor well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.\nThis should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time\nwill tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was \ncreated for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.\nThat and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press\nportrays a group of people as \"nuts\" or crazies, a violation of those\npeople's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the \ngurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the\n2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk \nvoted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with\ndomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.\n  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the \nofficial press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to\npublic safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.\nSo far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very\nagency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their\nadvantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they\nwere portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification\nwhat so ever of doing what they did.\n   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,\nmay mislead the public from the truth of the matter.\n\nJust as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton\nleads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's\n(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be\nunconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).\nAnd since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved\nin this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to \nfind out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.\nIt would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly\nunconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement). \n\n\n****************************************************************************\nThe above opinions are mine and mine only.\nI'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.  If you must flame\nthen flame away, but a well constructed argument will be much more respected.\n\nYoung-hoon Yoon                         yoony@rpi.edu\n211 North Hall                          n6zud@hibp1.ecse.rpi.edu\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute        N6ZUD/2   HL9KMT(former)\nTroy, NY 12180"

        "content": "A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:\n\n1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation\n   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult\n   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit\n   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,\n   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\n\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\n   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\n   you could!\n\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm\n   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\n   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say\n   uncomplimentary.\n\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\n   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\n   the \"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\"\n   flag.  Sigh.\n\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\n   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it\n   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's\n   paranoid delusions.\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>\n\nDan S."

Douglas noted, \"If a powerful sponsor is lacking,\nindividual liberty withers -- in spite of glowing opinions and\nresounding constitutional phrases.\"\n \nThe legislative scorecard outlined below resulted from subcommittee,\ncommittee, and floor action.  Many important victories, however, come\nfrom coordinating with legislators to ensure anti-gun/anti-hunting\nlegislation is either amended favorably, rejected, or never voted.\nThese quiet victories are no less impressive in protecting our\nfundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution.\n \n  ****\n \nArizona - SB 1233, NRA-supported legislation concerning minors in\ncriminal possession of firearms  passed the House 36-18, is currently\nawaiting action by the Governor.\n \nArkansas - HB 1447, Firearms Preemption Legislation was signed by the\nGovernor making this the forty-first state to pass preemption.\nPreemption had passed twice in previous sessions only to be vetoed by\nthen Gov.

Despite opposition to the ban --\naired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on\nthe issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the\nreferendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to\nreverse public opinion on the controversial issue.\n \nAn October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found\n57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  By\nelection day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,\n51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to\nhave the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign\ncommittee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,\nrelied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TV\nadvertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications\nraised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.\n \nDespite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madison\ninitiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to have\nthe Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.\n \n                Downloaded from GUN-TALK (703-719-6406)\n                A service of the\n                National Rifle Association\n                Institute for Legislative Action\n                Washington, DC 20036\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com"

        "content": "Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith\n\n                           WEIRD SCIENCE\n\nEveryone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips \nmove.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are \npoliticians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase \n\"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.  \n\nYears ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice \nAge might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke \nand dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international \nunpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even \nhave killed the dinosaurs.  \n\nWhat we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, \nthat real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended \nto discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken \nvalues that made America the most successful culture in history, \nand that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague \nwhen continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  \n\nWe miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William \nSound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't \nsupposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least \n100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never \nknow it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit \ntheir agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and \nthat nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  \n\nBut for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of \nscience as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to \nunscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \"scientists\" \nhave agendas of their own.  \n\nNobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is \ngoing to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that \nthere is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money \nand power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and \nthey hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical \ncrisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  \n\nThe same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up \nby the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private \nindustrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and \nfoisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on \nspecialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  \n\nThe list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  \n\"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and \ncontradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than \na last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era \nwhen state central planning and the command economy have failed and \ncan only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  \n\nDecades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth \nand panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear \npower is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy \nknown to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount \nof energy there is available to any individual in society, the \nfreer that individual -- and his society -- become.  \n\nHonest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and \nself-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as \nideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive \nreductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have \nbeen suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  \n\nAnd what the media didn't say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the \neffect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non-\nsmokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of \nmagnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a \nweek or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether \nthere was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  \n\nThat, of course, is the real threat represented by politically \ncorrect science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice \nto know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy \npractice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's \nscience, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is \nhighly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet \nthe stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There \nisn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of \ngovernment money on the scientific establishment.  \n\nTwo centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies \nto which every other nation in the world has been subject at one \ntime or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and \nreligion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has \ntried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of \nabortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street \n-- has wound up being shed.  \n\nReal human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's \nlives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of \nlivelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, \nto diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels \nfor electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, \nwhen they die from the effects of obesity.  \n\nWhat we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two \nmore centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of \nstate and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; \nreal science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will \nsimply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and \neveryone will benefit.  \n\nL.

I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\nbehind it.  What's going on here?\n\nLet's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\nI'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\nbecause I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\n\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\nhim over the edge.\n\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\n\nLet's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\n\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\nshow the world how big her balls are.\n\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my \nvery soul.\n\nJohn\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?"

        "content": "Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\n\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.\n\nMonday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.\n\nSynopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that\nRandy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National\nFirearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\n\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\n\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\n\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\nWhite cause.\"\n\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\n\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\nof the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\nWeaver otherwise.\n\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\nWeaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must\nhave also been phone taps.\n\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\n\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\nwife's voice on the tape.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\nthis trial is not explained.\n\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\nHarris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.\n\nTuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. \nKenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue."

The police didn't feel she was\nin a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.\n\nWhat do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault\nfor daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she\ndidn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the\ncase, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and\npray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all\nsituations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.  \n\nLarry Sacks\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nlsacks@angelo.amd.com"

What exactly did I claim?\n     --------------------------------------------------\n    \"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\n  to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"\n     --------------------------------------------------\n  \n    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're\n  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\n  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\n  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n  \"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n  \nLater in the same post:\n     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\n  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\n  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\nFine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are\n\"inclined\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\n\nPreviously Awesley had written:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nPrompting me to write:\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nTo which Awesley replied:\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\n  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a\n  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.\n\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But\nthat too is ludicrous.\n\nI wrote:\n  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n  it. \n\nAwesley relied:\n     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\n  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also\n  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\n\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \nArmy tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\n\"this has gone far enough.\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\ndo not.\n\nI wrote:\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\nAwesley wrote:\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \"yes, I\nshelled Americans,\" or \"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\" or \"I\nhelped cover it up\"?\n\nI wrote:\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\nprefer\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\n  that they did fire their guns.\n\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?\n\nAwesley concludes:\n     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\n  this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\n  account I cited.\n\nActually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as\nwell as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last\nword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with\nimpunity--I am dropping the subject.\n\n--John L. Scott"

According\n-> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined \n-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\n-> \n-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\n\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\n\"well regulated malitia.\"  Here is what is says about its character:\n\n\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\n\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\n\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\n\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\n\t character of a well-regulated militia, \n\nIt also talks about the \"well regulated militia\" having a nationally\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \n\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\n\n    \tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n\ta year.\n\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \n\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \n\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\n\n\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \n\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \n\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \n\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \n\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \n\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \n\tNational Guard.\n\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\n\n\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \n\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \n\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \n\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \n\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \n\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\n\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \n\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\n\n\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \n\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n\trecital of particulars.\"\n\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\n\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\n\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \n\t   this puzzle\"\n\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\n\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:\n\t   explain an error\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\nfor \"qualify\" is:\n\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\n\t   of; characterize.\n\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \n\t   task.\n\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\n\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\n\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\n\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \n\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \npeople's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\nme.\n\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\n\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?  I \nforce my version of \"our Liberties and Rights\" by begining statements\nof what \"our Liberties and Rights\" with \"All that the Second Amendment \nclearly states to me.\"   Using expressions, such as \"states to me,\" \nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.\n\nSo in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\nRights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\nthe matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.

        "content": "A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:  \n\nQuestion #1\n\nAccording to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is\n'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a \n\"concealed and dangerous weapon.\"  There is no statutory provision for\nobtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.'\n\n*  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm\non one's person or within his immediate control and available for use.\n\n\n\nDoes this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it\nhave to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What\nif one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\nperiod? \n\nQuestion #2\n\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \ntrial for the shooting?\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?\n\nPlease send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g\na little faster than I can handle.

        "content": "First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and\nerudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.\nFrankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of\nthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the\nwritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.\n\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\nMy brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\n\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\nbut are probably similar.\n\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\n\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\n\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \n\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\n\n>No, I simple stated that the people have a right to \"join a well\n>organized militia.\"  And I have also stated that a militia that\n>meets once or twice a year is clearly \"well organized.\"  And this\n>state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a \"right\"\n>to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated\n>by Hamilton. \n\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\n\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\nFederal Courts.\n\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\ntheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\nbe so bold.\n\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\nConstitution.\n \nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \n\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.\n-- \nDonald R.

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\nstandoff ensued.\n\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\ninsane.\n\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\nagents against the compound.\n\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\n\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\nimplementation of the decision.\n\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\n\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\n\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\ncircumstances.\n\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\nhas been learned now.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\nafter 51 days, you decided --\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\nwith --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\nfirst and then the other.\n\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\ncan't do it at once.\n\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\n\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\n\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\nI was given were the following:\n\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\nneeded in other parts of the country.\n\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\nmembers to come out.\n\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\nthe passage of time.\n\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\nunsafe conditions.\n\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\nincrease with the passage of time.\n\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\nsignificance.\n\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\ntoday.\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\nto unfold.\n\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\n\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\n\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\nchildren.\n\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\n\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\ndecide that way?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\nevidence we have.\n\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\njust began to spin downward.\n\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\nThat's what they thought.\n\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\nhave gas masks?\n\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\nyou in agreement with that?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\ncountry.\n\n   (more, more)\n -30-"

The\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\n\n     Q  What federal laws --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\n\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\nwhere they could be protected.\n\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\n\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\n\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\nmind during those horrendous moments?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\n\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\n\n     Thank you.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.\nAnd I do support her.\n\n     She is not ultimately responsible to the American\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as\nwell as she could have.\n\n     Thank you.  (Applause.)\n\n -30-"

Glover\n>----------------\n\nThe Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that \nthe two sides have exchanged roles.\n\nThe USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population)\nthan any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California,\nit is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in\nCalifornia is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of\nthese inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police\nnow confiscate property, without trial, under a \"good faith probable\ncause\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug\ndealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a\nmajority will answer \"yes\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and\ndue process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The\nMessage That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't\nknow whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but\nI would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.\n\nAccording to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over\nTWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the\nmarijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own\nbusiness and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves\nthan users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under\nthe \"War on Drugs\" campaign of \"zero tolerance\" due process protections\nhave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have\nproliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians\nwho favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only\nlegal, but political:  \"My fellow Americans, we must send our young\npeople the message that we are serious about winning the War On\nMurder\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun\nprohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine\nthey voted for believing it would be used only on those with different\ntastes in recreational drugs.\n\nWhat goes around comes around.\n\n\n    Alan T.

Over the last few\nyears I have heard of one case after another of government running\ncompletely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the\ngovernment's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I\nintend to put together what I call the \"American Horror File\": a\ncompilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod\nover the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing\nespecially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,\nand financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,\nbut including any other cases for which I can find decent\ndocumentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,\nred-hot enraged at their government.\n\nThe end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text\nand postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent\nyears.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage\npeople to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and\nprint out copies and give them to neighbors.\n\nThis is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on\nhow government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer\ninformation that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific\ninstances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to\njoin me in collecting and researching information for this project.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKevin S.

This is different from claiming\nthat they had ruled that it wasn't.\n\n> Yes, shotguns had been used in WWI, the Spanish-American War, and the\n> US Civil War. That was not in question. The possession of a sawed-off\n> shotgun was, i.e., a weapon altered to improve concealibility.\n\nI'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short-\nbarrelled (\"sawed-off\") shotguns in war.\n\nCompare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American \nWar; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by\nUS soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to \"tunnel rats\" \nin Vietnam, but, of course, \"Miller\" took place in 1939.\n\n> >> Therefore, US vs. Miller supports limited government regulation of \n> >> firearms.\n> >\n> >Don't go arguing down this road unless you are willing to abide by \n> >the consequences that you find at the end of it -- mainly, that the\n> >law-abiding common man has a right to own any weapon that has a militia \n> >purpose, from handguns to sawed-off shotguns and fully automatic weapons.\n> >That, in fact, is what this decision says.\n> \n> You are free to produce evidence that I'm not willing to abide with\n> all the implications of this. \n\nHere is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of \nguns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument \nunless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs\nin that class.  \n\nI think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe \nwe also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments \nhave been banning or trying to ban because they have \"no sporting purpose\" \nand \"no provate citizen would ever need these guns\" DO fall under the \nprotection of the Second.  \n\nSo, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at \nsome time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship \ntraining purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing \nthis point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.\n\n> Just because I don't whole-heartedly endorse the NRA position does not\n> mean that I oppose the RKBA.

Therefore, \"the right \n>of the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \n>regualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \n\nAh, clarification by obfuscation.\n\nActually, the words \"A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state\" is a present participle, used as an\nadjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of\nthe sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It\nasserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for\nmaintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or\nstate or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other\nthan the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a\nright of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,\nFourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.\nThe existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the\namendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right\nto bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of\na free state.\nIn other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and\nbear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.\n\n\n>So in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\n>Rights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\n>the matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.  For I am only\n>one person among many and the final word on \"Liberties and Rights\" cleary\n>and irrevocably belongs to the many.\n\nThe final word on liberties and rights should not belong \"to the\nmany\".  That is why we have a Constitution.  Otherwise, a tyrrany of\nthe majority can ensue from \"popular\" opinion, a concept which you\nshould be familiar with from the Federalist papers.\n\nAl\n[standard disclaimer]"

        "content": "This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n==============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nWednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \"evil\" federal\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\nagents \"sawed off\" shotguns and later failed to appear for\ntrial: Despite repeated \"good faith\" efforts to get Weaver\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\nwere taking an \"offensive action\" against an FBI helicopter\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\n\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\nalleged, want to become a \"regular supplier\").  The defense also\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\nhe wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\nangle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\nWeaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to \"look at the body\" [not recover?]\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\n\nProsecution quote: \"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\nthat confrontation.\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\n\nDefense quote: \"The evidence in this case is going to show that\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\nwith crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that\nthe government did commit.\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\n\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\n\"Tim\" again.  \"Tim\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \"ordinary,\nworking class people.\"  He also claimed he was for \"white pride,\nnot white power.\"\n\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\n\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\nrecounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the \"sawed\noff\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\ngood one!).\n\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\nbegin presenting evidence.\n\nDrew\n=============================================================\n\n\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************"

        "content": "This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n=============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nThursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.\n\nThis day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\n\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\n\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\n\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\nStriker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\n\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\n\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\n\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\nand fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\nBill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\n\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\"  Nevin also\npointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\ndecided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\nhim [no answer was available].\n\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\n\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\n\nDrew\n==============================================================\n\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************"

Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places?\n: In particular, three different places where there were no APV's?\n\nThe crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins\nof the BD compound.  The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was \ncrushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited, \nwould look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV \nnews.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off.\nPropane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent \nwith what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm...\n\n: And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying\n: to get out of the compound?\n\nRemember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.\nConflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being\nworn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those\non the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they\nthought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to\nput it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and \nconcussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable\nof moving.\n\n: And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.\n\nGood question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the \nthings that the FBI said (\"The BD's started the fire.\"  \"The BD's bodies\nwere found with gunshot wounds.\") that are now being refuted by the \nevidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making\nstatements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make\nthem sound like fact.  \n\n: I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe\n: a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the\n: contrary. Thought Experiment: Suppose this exact same thing happened under\n: the Bush administration. What would your answer be then? Would you still\n: prefer to believe the cultists?\n\nYes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop\nstring of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations\non numerous occasions.\n\nAnd as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until\nthey were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If\nthe BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be\ndead today?  \n\n: (No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.)\n\n: >But then\n: >again, that is how Mr. Clinton was elected, by people who believe that\n: >his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.\n\n: Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?\n\nYes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Now\nif we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of\napologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expected\naccountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco would\nhappen as often as they do.\n\n: So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty\n: people? Are they, like, just plain evil, or what? Did they just wake up\n: one day, stretch and yawn, and throw a dart at a map of the United States\n: to figure out who to oppress that day? I'm eager to know.\n\nAcutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of\nthis sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.  \nOddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after\nthe initial raid on the BD's.  \"Coincidence?  I think not!\"\n\nAnd as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over\nwalls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince\nthe world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by\nthe investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to \na gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the\nbuilding.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to \ncover its ass.  \n\n: And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? How is he\n: on diabolical laughter? Does he look good in a cape? These things MUST be\n: investigated. You first.\n\nOh, please.  If you want to argue, argue.  If  you merely want to demean those\nwho see this differently than you, then please go somewhere else.  \n\n: Mark Sachs IS: mbs110@psuvm.psu.edu\n\nKeith Marchington"

I have to disagree on\nall these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who\naren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to\ncommit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a\npositive way for police to respond to \"interpersonal violence.\"\n\n>>I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these \"statistics\" - I\n>>suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of\n>>students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun)\n>>to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students\n>>who carry a gun to school daily.\n>>\n> Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence\n\nWhat, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit\nsuicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL\nMETHODS per year?

The problem is not the guns,\nit's the parents!!!\n\n>  California schools reported a 200% increase in\n>student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between\n>1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in\n>schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the \"statistics\".\n\nAnd what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns?\nNOTHING.  No criminal prosecution, no expulsion, in most cases not even\nsuspension.  They take the gun, slap the kids on the wrist, say \"ain't it\nawful,\" and go on as if everything's back to normal.  What's wrong with\nthis picture?\n\n> Okay, maybe I worded it wrong...DAD.  I meant that to put children in a\n>situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the\n>act of a Messiah in my opinion.  I'm not saying that Koresh had control over\n>these children directly, but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is\n>would not let innocent children die.\n\nI don't think Koresh was the Messiah, either... but isn't it obvious that\nif he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him, then he\nbelieved the children were much safer inside the compound?  I didn't say\nhe was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what\nhe thought was going on.  He thought he had them in the one place where\nharm *wouldn't* come to them.\n\n>If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such, why\n>did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them\n>burn alive?\n\nLet's see *you* try to find the exits, unbarricade them, and flee a fire\nwhen you've been kept awake for most of 50 days by loudspeakers and subjected\nto six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault.\n\n  -joe"

Covey\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu>\nSubject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks\nDate: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)\n\n\nFolks,\n\nHail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\nthe following to the WSJ.\n\n-----\n\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\n\nPreston K. Covey\n\n\n\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \n \n\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\nhere. \n\n\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\ntake the bus?  \n\n\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\n\n\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\nhomes unaccounted.\n\n\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\nsix counts:\n\n\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\ncriminological hogwash.\n\n\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\ncrucially affect the risk. \n\n\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\nthe matter.\n\n\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\ndisregard this issue.\n\n\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \n\n\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\n\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \n\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \n\n\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\n\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com"

This was even during the 9 month period when he was being\nwatched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned\naccording to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting\nthem, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted\nto have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell...\n\nHe was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered\npeacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully).\nHe has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY.\n\nThe justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased\n$200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period).\nLast I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one.  I know of an\nINDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door\nshoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first, nobody I\nknow of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...').  Can you?\nI sure cannot.  Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated\nlike the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so, it\nis a 'so what' issue...  He wasn't bothering anyone (besides the\nBATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govt\npeople having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved\nreligeous group.  Are we required to not offend the BATF these\ndays?  I sure hope it hasn't come to THAT...\n\nMY point is, it DOES NOT ADD UP.  We need an independent investigation,\nand NOW.  Assuming other than FBI/BATF are preserving the evidence.\n\n>2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.\n\nThey had the premisis bugged.  I am inclined to think a further wait\nwould have saved lives.  One wonders why they didn't have emergency\ngear on hand when they moved, and why they didn't turn on the water\nwhen a fire was observed, instead of saying \"aw, gee, there is no water\".\n\nWhy so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the building\nhad pretty much finished burning?  Fireman safety?  Isn't that a decision\nthe firefighters should be allowed to make?  No water?  Why didn't\nthe Feds TURN IT BACK ON?  They sure could cut it off quickly enough...\n\nOne does wonder about the possibility of 'settling scores'...\n\n>3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the \"right\" course of action?\n>\n>And a few other questions.

You think she is going to be\nfacing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal?  You think\nshe is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found to\nhave acted wrongly?  I don't.  It is a nice PR gimmick, though.\n\nI am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation\nfor possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI.\nI expect to hear \"they are our best law enforcement.

The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms\nand tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have\nvery curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the\nchild-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco\nissues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with\nno violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then\nthe FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent\nin charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,\nmurder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend\nthe Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the \npublic what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault\non American citizens.

Their neighbours thought they were a little\nstrange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live\nnext door to.\n\nOne version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out\nof a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  If\nthis is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know\nthat a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof\nthat these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defend\nthemselves.\n\n: Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me\n: they *realy* belong in society ...\n\nIf you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it\nis not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  The\npeople who survived are claiming that the fire was started by\nthe tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI is\nclaiming that the 'cult' started the fire.\n\n'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but\nI'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say\nabout it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same.\n\nSome more interesting facts about the Waco incident:\n\n1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing\n    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least\n    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify\n    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as\n    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to\n    be police.\n    \n2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:\n    + \"We only had handguns\" - the original footage showed 4 BATF\n      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5\n      assault sub-machine gun.\n    + \"We were out gunned\" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the\n      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you\n      have the best guns available for the job.\n    + \"We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!\" -\n      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot\n      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that\n      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\n      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly\n      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are\n      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter\n      plywood.\n    + \"We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.\n       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.\n       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.\n       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.\"\n      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily\n      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.\n      \n3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one\n    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would\n    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did\n    AND that they are surprised that he did.

How would the city law apply to your impending \n|trial for the shooting?\n\nIt wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident\nin Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a\nhandgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand,\na black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend\nhimself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA\nDirector who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided\nnot to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs\nhas it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his\nhouse, and told him: \"this is stepping over the line; this could get\ndangerous for you.\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers\nwatched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief\nand his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.\n\n|Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\n|shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \n|either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \n\nL.V.

As long as Democrats reign in Chicago, Illinois\nresidents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. Politicians\nget around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry\nconcealed weapons. Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes\nout of office; because the Dems are always in power, the Illinois \nSupreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party's views on guns.\n[All candidates supported by political consultant David Axelrod are\nanti-gun, which explains anti-RKBA Crook County States Attorney \nJack(ass) O'Malley being a so-called \"Republican.\"]\n\nGet rid of the Chicago Democrats, get rid of their members on the IL\nJudiciary, and you got a fighting chance of a preemption law and a CCW\nlaw..."

Reading right to left, the fields\nare the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of\nthe file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need\nto be concerned with.\n\nTo get a file run the command \"get\" followed by the name of the file\nyou want, for example:\n\n\tget INDEX\nor\n\tget noduty\n\nAfter the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:\n\n\tTransfer complete.\n\t19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)\n\nYou can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.\nYou can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the\nfile you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025\nyou should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first\nand then retrieve it:\n\n\tcd congress/103rd\n\tget HR1025\n\nOnce you're finished you can log off with the command:\n\n\tquit\n\nIf you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little\ndifferent.  First of all you should find out if the file already\nexists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above\nand look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The\nindex will have a description of each of the files in the rkba\ndirectory.  For example:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFile: whitemanslaw\n\nWhite Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985\nReason magazine\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login\nand change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once\nyou are in the incoming directory use the command:\n\n\tput file_name\n\nIn this case:\n\n\tput whitemanslaw\n\nAgain there'll be a \"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered\nin so many seconds\" message.  Now your file is on the archive\nmachine.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure\nthere isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same\nas the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll\noverwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].\n\nYour file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a\nfile by the same name in the rkba directory.\n\nOnce your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for\nthe INDEX file and I will add it to the file.\n\nIf you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute\na file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.\n\nIf you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so\nbe sure to let me know first.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nMichael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..\n                (internal) mjp@bwa.kgn.ibm.com .. mjp at kgnvmy         \n (and last but not least a disclaimer)  These opinions are mine.."

Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary.\"\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] \"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] \"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion.\"\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

I'm not saying if that is a good thing\nor not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun\nbuyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are\nhaving an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatory\ncomponent to the program, they say \"well no...\"  So, in answer to your\nquestion, no, false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is to\nshow folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal\ngun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you can't measure\nthe impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test\nevaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  The police are\nessentially saying \"look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't\nwant it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community\".\nIf you, I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or\nineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.\n \n>>\n>> >>I do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or\n>> >>brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135,000 youths) are\n>> >>obtained easily and quickly, through a personal friend, or more often\n>> >>\"borrowed\" from a parent without their knowledge.\n>> >\n>> >I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these \"statistics\" - I\n>> >suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of\n>> >students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun)\n>> >to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students\n>> >who carry a gun to school daily.\n>> >\n>>  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence\n>> or the Centers for Disease Control.

        "subject": "Waco Questions",
        "content": "Folks,\n\nIt's time to start building some precise questions to send to our\nfederal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our\nlocal TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be\nasked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \n\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\n     the BATF obtained?\n\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \n     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant \n     in a manner prescribed by law?\n\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\n     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \n\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\n     dispossessed weapons.\n\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\n\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\n     situation? \n\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\n\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\n\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \n     penetrated?\n\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\n\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\n\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\n     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is \n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\n\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \n     shots from high-power rifles?\n\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\n\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************"

        "subject": "Re: JFFO has gone a bit too far",
        "content": "Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:\n\n1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\nthe book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\nlaw; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, \nurban-folklore style.\n\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't \nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\n\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\nlaw registry].\"\n\nBingo.  Exactly.  \n\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there's absolutely no reason to \nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \nherrings.\n\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \nto have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd \ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \nwouldn't he?\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it\non their own?\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd's motivation isn't a \nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\n\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\" -- so \nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\n-- \n\t\t\t\t\t-- Don Porges\n\t\t\t\t\tporges@inmet.camb.inmet.com\n\t\t\t\t\t..uunet!inmet!porges"

He left his third-floor bedroom and began\nlooking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and \nchecking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    \ncompound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.\n   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them\nwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the \nsix said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    \nsince Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's \nphone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the\ncults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.\n    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel\ncompound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD\nmeanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the\nwomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all\nunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    \nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\nit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.\nHundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling\nthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than\nthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\nother flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked \ntogether with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's\nescaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings.

Wright\n\n(1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct\n    sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.\n\nOnly about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most\nrecent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a\nlicensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six --\nobtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving\nfriends and associates, family members, and various black market\noutlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources\nincluded cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and\noften theft.  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated\nby informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nINDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 4- 91\nIndependence Institute\n14142 Denver West Parkway #101\nGolden, CO 80401 \n(303) 279-6536\n\n              WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY\n                             By David B. Kopel\n\n     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville.\nThe study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous\ncriminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable\nimpact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns\nare purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.\n\n51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal\nEnforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of\n20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;\nof those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who\ncommitted crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)\n(of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony\nconvictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and\nFirearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to\nDirector, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony\nrecords who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or\nnon-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nINDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 12-91\n\n                          THE ASSAULT WEAPON PANIC:\n                      POLITICAL CORRECTNESS\" TAKES AIM\n                            AT THE CONSTITUTION\n\n                      By Eric Morgan and David Kopel\n\n     Testimony before Congress revealed that most \"assault weapons\" in the\nhands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  The testimony\nis consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findings\nbased on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by\nsociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent\nof criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The\nfigures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the\ncriminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents\nof gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and\nprobably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of\nguns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime\ndirectly target the black market in criminal guns, and\nleave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wright\nbelieves that the consequences of current \"assault weapon\" legislation on\nstreet violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun\ncontrols aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of\ncriminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new\nbusiness.{100}\n\n6.   _See, _e.g., The Anti-drug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

It's one\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\n\n       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \nthemselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\nthe evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\npeople jump off buildings.)\n\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn't mean they\nweren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\nkid might.\n\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\nkilled.\n\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\nbusinesses.)\n\n>Studies by the \n>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence\n>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member\n>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.\"\n\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I\nwill point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\n\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\nit's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

The text follows.\nThe Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student\n(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...\n\n(The title was the only thing they changed/added)\n\n\"Gun Stats\"\n\nThe Daily recently reprinted an article from the\nWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton\nQuigley, author of \"Armed and Female.\"  The article,\nin turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally\nreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The\narticle states, \"A study... found that a gun in the home\nwas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,\nspouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.\"  This\nis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-\neral reasons, outlined below:\n\nThe study gives the impression that, if you own a \ngun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to \ndefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned\nagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take into\naccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun \nto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-\ntrator.\n\nThe study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather\nthan 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\nfriend.\n\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample \nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\n\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be \nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an \naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a \ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies \nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\nused to commit suicide.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can \nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.

        "content": "Well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the \ncompound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes \nfrom Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. \nUnfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits \nrequired approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally \nout to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local \ncommunity volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By \nthe time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame \nand it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers \nand no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, \nbut the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not \nhave one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the \nline of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient \nequipment and water to make a difference.\n\nThey even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia \nasking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably \nirresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local \ncalls could get through.\n\nABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who \nviewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the \nstandard \"pool shot\"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been \nstarted in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant \nto spread so fast.\n\nNeither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed \nthemselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot \nstronger proof than some of the \"theories\" floating around the net.\n\nScore 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians.

What you said about constitutionality\nof law needs to be clarified.  I believe that an unconstitutional law was \nnever constitutional.  When a law is determined by the Supreme Court, to be\nunconstitutional, that law was never really a law.  The very nature of the law\nbeing unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception.  Please correct\nme if I'm wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyone\nconvicted of breaking that law is absolved.\n   I don't believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court.

If they needed\nto assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the\nfederal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type\nassaults all the time.  And they are very, very good about it, in both the\ntactical and legal parts of it.

But they had to use their own\nguys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun\ncontrol.   \n\n\tI also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. \nInitial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their\n\"assault weapon\" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget\nwas going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno got\nconfirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line);\nright around the presidents 100th day in office.

There are not all that many people who have both the skill\n   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.\n   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but\n   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun\n   - and would pay through the nose for it.\n\nGood point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,\nhomemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate\nfire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall\nthe tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for\nuse by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of\neffective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of\nkilling German soldiers for their guns.\n\nAlso note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was\nspecifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.\nThe point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel\ntubing, hand tools and a welder.\n\nI still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference\nbetween marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown\nlocally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I\nthink the demand for \"real\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling\neconomically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the\nresult would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have\nfirearms, and \"bad guys\" will continue to have access to them, one way\nor another.

That is their strong suit.\n\tBut the public must question why agents of the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper-\national skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve\nthe 51-day standoff free of flames and fury.\n\tThe loss of life most clearly reflects the demen-\ntia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personal\ndelusiosn are now seared on the public conscious-\nness.  His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of\narms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way of\nrationality could be expected from Koresh, a self-\nconfsesed \"sinner without equal.\"\n\tWhat continues to mystify are th eactions of\nfederal agents, who bungled the case from the\nstart.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when\n100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-\nbacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent\non seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap-\nons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem-\nbers died inteh ensuing gun battle.  Earlier\noppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the\ncomplex had not been adequately explored.\n\tAuthorities prepared a siege and resolved that\nthose deaths would be the last.  Fifty-one days into \nthe siege there was no public outcry to storm the\ncompound.\n\tIt had been correctly perceived that the chil-\ndren inside \"Rancho Apocalypse\" were essentially \nhostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no\nreason for the government to be impatient.  The\ngovernment's superior firepower, control of water\nand utilities and freedom of movement created the\nconditions for a belated but bloodless resolution.\n\tNeither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the\nFBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for\nabandondoning the course of patience.\n\tIf intelligence was accurate and Koresh was\ngrowing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi-\ncult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an\nM-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re-\nports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they\nwould have to be weighted against the potential for\neve ngreated hamr.\n\n\netc etc tec....\n[paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted]\n\nBut some of the responsibility rests with Clinton,\nand inexperienced president who did not pay\nenough attention to the life-and -death decisions\nbeing made on WAco.\n\tIf Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would\nbe for her overreliance on the judgment of law en-\nforcement officers--a common problem among\nprosecutors.\n\tFull investigations into th eWaco tragedy must\nbe conducted by both the executive and legislative\nbranches.

If crime stopped in the presence of\nstrict gun control, there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it.\nHowever, if gun control made absolutely NO IMPROVEMENT in the violent \ncrime rate, THAT'S when I would have it lifted.

I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported\non in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action\nis as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a \nweapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!)\nand that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile \naction he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!)\nRepeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking\ngun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and\nI will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's\n ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's\npracticality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45)\nIF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER\nWILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not\nbother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a\nBystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!)\ncall the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on \nthe ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will\nuse it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and\nthat of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none\ncame forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded\nwith the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special\npurpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing\nlawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you\nfully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can\nthink of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the\nGlaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose\nand stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court.\n(ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not \nricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often\ncross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with\none shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court.\nBe as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were.\nRepeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the\nsame questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see\nif your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification\nand weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your\n politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are\nrequired in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to\nhold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one,\ncontact the NRA. They have a legal assistance fund.(Or at least they used to)\nI DO HOPE YOUR A MEMBER! (Not my business either way though..)

A gun kills people.  \n\nRather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\n\n>But let's ignore guns for defence and/or crime and look at gun accidents.\n\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\n\n...\n>But seriously: a gun is designed to fire a bullet.   This is not so you\n>can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range.\n\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\nwould, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\nkill people.\n\n>This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show\n>someone  that you have a gun and they go \"Gee, perhaps I should leave\".\n\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\nof firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\n\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\nthe best.[3]\n\n>No, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human\n>body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow, for most.\n\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\naren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\n\n\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\ngovernment.\"\n\t- T. Jefferson.\n\nI think what Jefferson said is still true.\n\n>And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes\n>off into the wrong fleshy target.\n\nNot very often compared to other use.[3]\n\n>Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife.\n\nThis isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \"get-pissed\" and kill\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\npeople wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.\n\n>Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to\n>kill things.  Right?\n\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\nnever have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\nI don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm\nafter, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\nparticularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.\n\n\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\n\t48700 deaths by auto\n\t11300 deaths by fall\n\t 5300 deaths by drowning\n\t 4800 deaths by fire\n\t 4400 deaths by poison\n\t 3200 deaths by food\n\t 1400 deaths by firearm\n\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\n     \"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\".

Neil Smith by Cathy Smith\n\n\n                         THE LIES OF TEXAS\n\nOkay, what have we learned?\n\nFor reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known \n-- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative \ncommittees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard\nof the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and \npersonal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the \nFirst, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe Constitution. \n\nThe man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw \nagency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own \nlosses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his \nelectricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside \nworld. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in \npronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency \nfinds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit \neager to gain credit for \"straightening out the mess\" -- and, more \nimportantly, to script his side of the subsequent \"negotiations\" \nany way they please. \n\nThe impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time \nfour L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a \nsingle individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. \nArmored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers \nusing scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious \nrecords at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive \nthose in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority \nwill mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean \nCommunists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). \n\nFinally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising \nof the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house \nand gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and \nis reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, \nincluding those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. \n\nSpokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the \nPresident all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: \nblame the victim. \n\nHe had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a \nsecret government workshop and planted among the cinders being \n\"examined\" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children \n-- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. \nHe set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in \n3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that \nJim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to \nembarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was \nsevered at the start of the whole travesty. \n\nA leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe \nthat a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow \nresponsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever \nknow 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound \nmore like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? \n\nVery well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never \nforget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and \nrightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, \nit was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which \nmay explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage \nand integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) \nabout the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a \nmouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. \n\nMore importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower \nof Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance \nas Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the \nsystem, then at least within yourself. \n\nOn March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of \nthe Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw \nagency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised \nin its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both \nagencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped \nto write that plank. \n\nTrue, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in \n1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone \nin a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their \nbehinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what \nhappened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, \nWaco never would have happened. \n\nThink about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough \nof political parties more interested in collecting and holding \npower -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human \nlife -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe \nthe change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less \ntiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.\n\nThink about it.\n\nL.

A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are\nimmediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid\nof. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The\nstranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the\nhouse as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The\nmugger...the rapist. \n\nAnd what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door\nlocked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and\nalways, there's the implied question \"what's a pretty little thing like\nyou doing without a husband around to protect you?\n\nBut what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10\nyears to devote learning judo?\n\nWhat if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that \"rape victims\nusing armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -\nand were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any\nother form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for\nrobbery/assault)(Kleck,123) \n\nWhat if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend\non the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a\ncrime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that\nthe police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the\nwhole community.\n\nAs a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice\nthemselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to\nhelp themselves?\n\nHere's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says\n\"no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-\npound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out.\" But if\na woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient\nmeans possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.\n\"Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!\" they ask. How could you\nhurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from\nyou. In truth, 1% of \"defensive gun uses\" result in the offender taking\nthe gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)\n\nWell, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already\nmade that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be\nvictimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more\nguns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching\nothers, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are\npreparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.\nWe're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're\ngoing to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE\nINTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.\n\nBut there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more\nsecretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.\n\nThat menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that\ngovernments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed\npeople. It's the way they survive.\n\nIn our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people\nboth at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and\nthreatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next -\nwhat freedom we will lose because some government goon decides\n\"it's for your own safety\" or \"we know best\". Any person who acted\nlike government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his\nlife and locked up as a habitual offender.\n\nBut this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who\nshould be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt\nme? Then why did you file your income tax? \n\nLike any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something\nthat can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's\nreally after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're\nafter me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,\nMetzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for\nour assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. \n\nAs citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices\ngiven to women: to surrender or to fight. \n\nSurrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the\ndisappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. \n\nA battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep\nthe government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if\nthey have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:\n\"the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.\"\n\nAs a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will\ndo my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,\nand speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always\nremember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it\ncan lead to Tiananmen Square. \n\nWhen the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep\nthem from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,\nI intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter\nwhat laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more\nsubstantial in my hand than a brick. \n\nMy opinions are, of course, my own."

        "content": "In the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions with\npeople from this group.  In particular, we discussed how cults\noperate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave\nthe way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing\nwith cults and similar organizations.\n\nI include an edited account of what I wrote.  The identity of my\ncorrespondents have (I hope) been erased.  The editing process makes\nthe text choppy - sorry about that.  I've tried to retain the\ninformation content.\n\nEllipses (...) indicate where text was removed.  A few of the comments\nin parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders to\nunderstand.\n\nThese notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize.\n\nCheers(?),\nOded\n\n------------------------ (begin included text) -----------------------\n\nI took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ...  The course included\ncults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external\nreading too).\n\nWilliam Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of\n\"evil\" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what\nwould motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,\nand by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think\nthe books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced\n..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I\nthink they're onto something.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\tHow cult psychology works...\n\t[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]\n\nSo long as Koresh could \"own\" his people, he made sure they didn't\nbelieve there was any life out there for them, away from him.\nOtherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians\nrecounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived\nonly through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.\nAbsolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they\nbelieved him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even\nthe Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left\nhim, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces\nof the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)\ncouldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die\ntoo, like the folks in Jonestown.\n\nFor a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife\n(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then\nthemselves.  That's the consequence of shattered \"cultism.\"  It really\ndoes happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such\ncases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no\nmatter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]\n\n...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?]\n\nI agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good\n(?)  reasons for news blackouts.\n\n>\tThe only fact available is that had the FBI not acted  \n>\tyesterday, those people would be alive today.\n\n ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh\nmade sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.\nHence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He\nheld them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing\nwould really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!\n\nLook at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,\nat the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once\nJonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his\nentourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd\nbe busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought\nup by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are\ntapes...  The \"logic\" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it\nwouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people\nwho brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by\nTHEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the\nsame with the Branch Davidians.\n(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER\nWHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)\n\n...\nThe only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate\nreports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying\nfull-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the\noff chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...\n\nSo, the only way the BATF/FBI could \"save\" those people, and future\ncults, is by ignoring such signs.\n\nI suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him\ninto letting them go, or somehow influencing \"his\" people to abandon\nhim while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.\n... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that\nwith blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe\nthey're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's\ncertainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.\n\n...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]\n\n    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from\nKoresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.\n\n    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd\nwant to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning\nboneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_\nplaying chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at\ncheckmate time people really die, and I could be blamed.\n\n...\n\nI don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you\ndeny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and\nthe rest of the gummint should exist at all. \n\n\t\t(the end)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t\t\t  Okay, have at it."

But to\nthink there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and\nthat these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These\nagencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have\nultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then\ntell the Prez, who says, \"I knew all along\".  While this may not seem right,\nor it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command\nleading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after\nall, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and\nmaybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if\nthey should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses\nare a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority\nreligion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of\ncults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.\nKoresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do\nnot practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is\ndigging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are\nassociated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about\nwould not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt\nBATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was\nunjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S\ngovernment is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I\ndo believe that some of the things that former cult members have said\nare true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President\nClinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives\nshould be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from\nreaching its full potential."

I'm just getting started with this\ntype of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low.\n\nComments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed.\n\n****************************************************************************\n\nEditor, \n\nI would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to\nthe \"right to keep and bear arms\", and to a greater degree, the many other\n\"rights\" that we take for granted on a daily basis. \n\n1.\tYou're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  You\ncall the police.  How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while\nyou are waiting for the police to arive? \n\n2.\tYou are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A \"good\nsamaritan\" stops to \"help\", when you find you and your family at gun-point or\nknife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family? \n\n3.\tYou are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appears\nsuddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are you\nstrong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rape\nyou in order to survive the attack? \n\nIf the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep\nand bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun\nmay not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going\nto let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to\ndefend yourself and your family? \n\nMany times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If\ncertain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm\nammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law\nenforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition\nfor use in your handgun. \n\nThere is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feel\nthat any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for\nthe purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?\n\nOur local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,\nor in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   while\nwaiting for help to arrive. \n\nThere is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit\nthe sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  One\nelected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! \n\nI want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected\nofficials decided that they should only belong to a \"certain church\", or go to\nchurch on a \"partiular day\"?  What if you were told that you could only read\ncertain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had the\nright to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peaceful\nmanner? \n\nThese are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments.\nIf we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fight\nfor the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  When your life\nis affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights by\ndefending your Second Amendment rights."

Reactors\nblow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes\nfrom fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See\nwhat a can of worms this is?  Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just\nnorth of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the\nsodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision\nreactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the\nPRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor\nitself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can\nbe made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is\nflawed in a few respects already.\n\n>  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses \n>in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause \n>death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of\n>people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or\n>cropland.  \n\n\tTyphoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed.

Calcium Carbide\nis a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas.  It can\nbe used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or for\nmaking carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.  Toss some in a\ntoilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that\nit can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance.\nSo, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I\nstill have those pesky gophers.\n\n>I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for \n>definitions.\n\n\tThe basis for, but I'm sure you see that the problem is not\nin writing a law, it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and\nextended beyond the point where it does any good.\n\n>>I'll give\n>>you a little hint:  see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the\n>>road?

It is an instrument that\ncan be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose,\nand despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers\nsupply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass\ndestruction is rather a given.\n\n\tIt's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not\nsee a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly\nimpossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some\npretext or another.  The looser your definition, the more ripe for\nabuse that law is.  Furthermore, if you get specific then the old\nstandby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to\nbe added to, generally without going through the hassles of another\nvote and public reading of the law.

        "subject": "Don Kates' talk on the Branch Davidians",
        "content": "This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:\n\nI recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk\nat the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was\nall set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy\nconclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough\nsummary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as\nexactly what he actually said...\n\nKates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire\nthan the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not\ndiscuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.\n\nKoresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This\nisn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has\nbeen ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel\nhatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to\npeople like Koresh.\n\nLengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.\nThere were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.\nPolice originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they\ncalled local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for\nprotection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were\nchanged to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many\nsmall police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not\nlarge enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of\norganizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the\nFBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they\nwere to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).\n\"All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that\npower.\"\n\nThe BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid\nillegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners\nno longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills\ndisappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its\nexistence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.\nAround the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media\nis alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a\npre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door\nand the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a\ngun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't\ninvited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but\nif any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents\nremoving armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in\nchains.\n\nThe Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for\nreview.\n\nKates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and\nthat the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot\nat, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100\nagents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had\nsome medical personnel on hand.\n\nHe confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest\nin connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on\nthe phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and\nthe sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could\nbe tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns\nback.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached\nrationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.\n\nThe BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they\naudit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his\nfollowers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and\nthey reacted accordingly.\n\nWith respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates\nwas giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that\nthe BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their\ninformants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had\nmore to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been\ncompletely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to\nknock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for\nthus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,\nthen it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns\ndown the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF\nbreaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the\nDavidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served\nwarrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A\nclose look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_\nhave shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was\nthe first shot fired!\n\nThe role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial\nposition on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the\nview that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held\noff a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI\nwent in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was\nbeginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the\npublic's sympathy.\n\nShould the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,\ndiverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents\nlike this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,\nwell-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have\neven more tragic results.\n\n   - Lyn Bates\n     (bates@bbn.com)\n\nPS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston\nCollege Law School next Tuesday, April 27.

Besides,\nthe ranch house (not \"fort apocalypse\"; it was just a house despite what\nthe FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The \"Gun loonies\" couldn't hardly\nhave been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.\nThe FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there\nto put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well*\nunder way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't\neven tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that\nthe FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in\nthis fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.\nSomeone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.\n\nSadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media\nand the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it\nup as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American\npeople will probably believe them.\n\n> Next question.\n> \n> \n> The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters\n> to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place.\n\nThis is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that\nis becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns\n*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On\nthe other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal\nguns then the government did have the right to search their compound.\nBut, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons\nhasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke\nany laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this\nis his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.\nThe ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol\nviolations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should\nstay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of\ntheir jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.\n\n> The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to\n> attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention.

Human life---children and adults\nalike---should be treated with respect---even if they are \"heavily-armed\nreligious wackos\".\n\nDavid Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out\npeacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON\nTHEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause\nthis senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE\nLIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.\n\n> It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity \n> to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead\n> he ordered the murder of the children.\n \nDon't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the\ncult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that\nit knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on\nfire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions\nof committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.\nTherefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED\nEVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still\ndon't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the\nWaco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.\n\n> In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive\n> the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the \n> suicide/murder of his other 80 followers.

They\nhad MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic\npistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later\nretracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.\n\n> The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely.

He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off, he saw he was being\nATTACKED with no overt action from him (yet).  He could no more say 'oh,\nits ok, its only stun grenades' anymore than I could.  He slammed the door at\nthat point and proceeded to repel the attackers.  He felt in genuine fear\nof his life - I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point.  Have\nyou ever been shot at?

Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably\nhas that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he is\nan avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal,\nnor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also note\nthat the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, what\nis the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad\nfor some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming\nthe unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?\nThis administration has only one thing in mind.  CONTROL.  PEOPLE CONTROL.\nWhether it is gun control, Clinton Cripple Chip, National smart ID cards,\nit all boils down to PEOPLE CONTROL.

The kegs were charred\nbadly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case\nof the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away.\n\nMany of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood\non all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the\nrifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were\nfound still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into \nthe wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually\ndislodge them.

You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief\njust as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone who\ndoesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and\ntherefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what the\ngovernment says is wrong to be wrong.\n\nDavid Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists,\nmethodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT\neven though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe\nthe same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid\nto mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment.\nYou see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others\nfit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned \nfrom it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice\njust isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I go\nmy own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else,\neither individually or collectively as the great socialist \"we\" has ANY \nRIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong.\n\nYou seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to\njust forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound\nin order to \"save themselves\".  Think (if you're capable) for a moment\nabout some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if\nsuddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are\nbeneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear\nenough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct\ncourse of action for your government to initiate actions specifically\ndesigned to force you to make that \"forsake or die\" decision?\n\nThe \"forsake or die\" option is exactly what the government forced on the\nDavidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that\nfirst shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51\nwhen they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and\nchildren holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The\npeople who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose\nindividual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who\nbelieved that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those\npeople go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.  People like\nyou who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with \"well they could\nhave come out\" get my most scornful contempt.  I'd spit in your face\nwere there not a network between us.

The squad was\nslowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some students\nwere taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two\nstudents who were following and taunting.\n\nThe series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while\noccasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from.\nAll at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1\nGarands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this\n45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with\nthe taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in\nthe confrontation.\n\nThere is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently\nthey had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had\nconveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio,\nJames Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known\nthat he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in.\n\nThe matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later, wounded survivors launched\na civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the\nterms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not\nidentified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified).\n\nIt was a tragic incident, but it was not provoked by the students, or apparently\nby General DelCorso or any of his command.  From studying the incident & the \nphotos, IMO it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers."

Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that\nDavid Koresh had \"explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40\nfeet into the air.\"  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of\nopportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the\nfirst place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas\ninto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a\nfortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because\nit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't\nthey do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or\nsimilar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been\nsaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.\n\nHere's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some\ntime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that\nthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I\ndon't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this\nso-called \"explosion\" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.\nWe figure that this is what it was because of how the \"explosion\"\nlooked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,\ndynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion\nin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something\nthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.\n\nIsn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four\nofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that\nsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown\nby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about\nwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they\nsaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE\nTHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?\nPerhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the\ncause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.\n\nWhat is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the\ncompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade\nbody during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on\nthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a\nspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this\ngrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only\npeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be\na shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,\nor explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their\nface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the\nrubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the\nATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to\nmake sure that others \"find\" what they want for them to \"find\" if\nyou know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here\nbut if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks\nhad gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.\nAlso recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents\nused grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot\n\nBefore:  \"David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets\n          the Bible through the barrel of a gun...\"  --ATF spokesman\nAfter:   \"[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets\n          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun...\"  --Me"

Why all the sour grapes ?\n\nBATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending\nbudget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big\ncommando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab\nKoresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, no\npropaganda value there. \n\nThe FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowed\nthe situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before the\nBDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan. \n\nThe BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined\nthat US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their\nlittle 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on\nthe BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should\nhave surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If the\nBDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like\nthe rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have\nobtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to\ndo. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies\nto themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest\nof us - at the voting booth. \n\nIf the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they have\nbecome that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get to\nvote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years,\nwe have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. When\nthe FBI was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seem\nto mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF is\nraiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand.\nWhen the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads, the\npublic doesn't mind. Suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves in\nthe current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent out\nof shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow.\n\nWaco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious\nfanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence.

Little groups of loonies\n\tdo not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey\n\tor what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us,\n\tthey get their say at the voting booth and if their personal\n\twants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad.\n\tIf they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could apply\n\tfor the proper permits.

You live on US territory, you live by\n\tUS laws - period. (unless you are a congressman)\n\n\tSure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and\n\tthe FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and\n\this core members while they were out in the streets of Waco.\n\tThe BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a\n\tpropaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big\n\tcommando-style assault is proof of that. They should be\n\troasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the\n\tother hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did.\n\tOnce the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and\n\tfinished it rather than let an interminable situation like that\n\ttake root. \n\n\tThe FBI also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again,\n\tthe laws we voters have approved, or the lawmakers who created\n\tthem, gave them the right to do what they did. If BATF and\n\tthe FBI are latter-day Gestapo, it is because the voters have\n\tallowed them to become that way. Waco was pure Americana -\n\tmilitarist mentality, religious fanaticism and unadulterated\n\tviolence all rolled into one experience. We get what we pay\n\tfor, or vote for, and this was the result of many choices\n\twe have made over the years. Don't blame 'them' - blame \n\tourselves. We made 'them', we ARE 'them'."

I'm sure that not many\npeople are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.\nSpeaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above\nquoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I\nam not taking into account city ordinances).

After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.\ntype folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,\nand surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.\nThe Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student\n(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...\n\n(The title was the only thing they changed/added)\n\n\"Gun Stats\"\n\nThe Daily recently reprinted an article from the\nWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton\nQuigley, author of \"Armed and Female.\"  The article,\nin turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally\nreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The\narticle states, \"A study... found that a gun in the home\nwas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,\nspouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.\"  This\nis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-\neral reasons, outlined below:\n\nThe study gives the impression that, if you own a\ngun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to\ndefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned\nagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take into\naccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun\nto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-\ntrator.\n\nThe study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather\nthan 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\nfriend.\n\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample\nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\n\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be\nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an\naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a\ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies\nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\nused to commit suicide.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can\nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has\nto consider carefully what questions were asked by\nthose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-\nrate conclusion from them.\n\nD.F.

Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it\nis when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding\nthe pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported\nby the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While\nthis may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not\npropel the bullet with any significant velocity.\n\nIn fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded\ncartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough\nto take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe.\n\nThus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause\nslight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.\n\n                               -- Alane --\n   /-----------------------------------------------------------------\\\n  /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    \"I am a jelly doughnut\"      \\\n /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \\\n/-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\"

Sounds a bit\n>>tacky, but hey, whatever works.\n\nAs David Veal points out, this sort of \"promotion\" would be used\nagainst gun owners by the mass media.\n\nHowever, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,\nfree, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40\nor $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.\n\nOur Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished\nteaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been\nvery well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices\ninterested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but\nfeel they should know something about \"gun safety\" since members\nof their family keep guns at home.\n\nTeaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:\n\n(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases\n    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.\n\n(2) A \"gun safety\" class is Politically Correct, and likely to\n    be viewed positively by the public and the media.\n\n(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)\n    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a\n    gentle introduction to firearms.\n\n(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun\n    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.\n\n(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners\n    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,\n    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate\n    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun\n    students sometimes tell us they have \"something new to think\n    about\" with regards to personal gun ownership.\n\n(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.\n\nOur course is the standard NRA-certified \"Home Firearm Safety\"\nclass, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also\nteach the NRA's \"Personal Protection\" class, although the cost\nis higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.\n\nI think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to\ngun buy-backs.\n\n                               -- Alane --\n   /-----------------------------------------------------------------\\\n  /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    \"I am a jelly doughnut\"      \\\n /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \\\n/-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\"

At least four federal agents and two cult members\n    were reported killed.  [...]\n\n    The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock\n    trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning,\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and\n    explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in\n    Washington.  [...]\n\n    Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,\n    throwing concussion grenades and screaming \"Come out,\" while three\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no\n    response.  Then the shooting began. \n\nI think \"storming the sect's head-quaters\" and \"throwing concussion\ngrenades\" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).\n\n> he was not just another guy minding his own business.

I hope you'll respond, and I seem to\nbe a Voice of Reason or some such (I've been recieving fan mail,\nso naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late), and hope to\nmake a few points here.\n\n>I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America !\n>What I've said is that there seems to be to MANY of them, and especially\n>to many in wrong hands....\n\n\tAnd our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people\nwho need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A\nfairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We\nall believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have\nfirearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding\nupon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to\ndo it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with\na philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting\nthe many?  We say \"no,\" while others say \"yes.\"\n\n>Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without\n>affecting good/responcible gun owners ??\n\n\tCan you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it.\n\n>I DO believe in a persons freedom.\n>What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it.\n\n\tOf course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention\nis how much one has to pay.\n\n>MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE\n>to give 'a little' to make that society work.\n\n\tIt is this \"giving a little\" that makes Americans wary...\nWe have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a\nChamberlain \"gave a little\" to a particular fascist/short asshole,\nand how such \"appeasement\" worked.  While it might work in some\ninstances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict\nthe future we must be cautious in using actions that have a\nhistory of failure.\n\n>Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point.\n>Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b,\n>so a car is essential in most parts....\n>Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't \n>argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....\n\n\tCars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in\nthe USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be\nwilling to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,\ncars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the\narguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more\npeople than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict\ncars than it does guns.  How one defines \"essential\" often depends\nupon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we\nlook at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.\n\n>EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were\n>more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!\n\n\tThis depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As\nDesert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even\nwhen given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did\nwith an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first\nacts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show\nthat dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.\nThus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown\nor if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.\nOne can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.\n\n>Is this discussion about\n>1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans\n>            or\n>2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ??\n\n\tIt is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have\nwound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that \"or\" was so logical.\n\n>Change of name.......\n\n\tThat was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out\nhow we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different\nbackgrounds politically.  I thought this would underscore my point on\nhow our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.\n\n>Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons.\n>(Child abuse for instance)\n\n\tBATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.

That document is in fact a justification not just for the right\nif revolution, but of the DUTY of revolution by the people, once the government\ngets too oppressive.  It is a very radical document, and I recommend all\nAmericans... especially those in office... read it once a year."

Oh, okay Charles,\nthat makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart\nFoundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational\nand that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES\nof death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation\nand diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes.\nPlease, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.\n \nI've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents\ngroup or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don't\nconfuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many\nvictims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don't agree.\nI'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of\nchildhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond\nto the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who\nwants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths\nis trying to make a political issue out of it.\n \n \n>> I assumed that any humane\n>> person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents\n>> gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.\n>\n>A \"humane person\" who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old\n>would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm;\n>Ignorance is our greatest enemy.\n>\n Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context\nfor your own purposes.  The statement that you responded to above is actually\nin reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed\nconcern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane\nperson and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined\nas \"a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest\nnumber of childhood deaths.\"  If that is the case, I'm extremely glad that I\nam inhumane and irrational.\n \n>>  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence\n>                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>What _other_ sources of information do you have which confirms their\n>data?  These folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts.\n>Perhaps you can verify their data with the Uniform Crime Report...\n>\nSorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting\nthe facts.  But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, \"Firearm murders\nof youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990\"\n \nIs the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state\nthat \"Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun\naccidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded\".\n \nOr how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say \"Gunshot\nwounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas\nbetween 1987 and 1990.\"\n \nDo you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state\nthat \"Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from\n1986 to 1988.\"\n \nCharles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly\nvictims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't\nrealize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go\ninto the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll\nby yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious\nthat you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion\nand that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political\ndiscussion.  I really don't want to do that.\n \n>> or the Centers for Disease Control.\n>         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>They have firearm statistics?  Are firearms a disease?\n>\n Charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the CDC.\nThey don't just study cancer and heart disease.  I've got news for you,\ninterpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic.  In 1984, Surgeon General\nC. Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health\nproblem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents.\n \n>> that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.\n>\n>In \"the lives of youths\" or in their schools?  I know a number of\n>youths who have firearms present \"in their lives\".  Is is quite\n>appropriate to teach children to safely handle firearms (this is a\n>\"presence\", right?).  What are you trying to say?  This innuendo\n>reminds me of listening to Bill Clinton.\n \nWHO THE F**K SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE\nFIREARM CHARLES??? In the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump\ninto a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1\nsentence that you decide to respond to. What the hell are you saying here???\nYou're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control\nissue out of a discussion that isn't.\n>\n>> The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that\n>> 400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.\n>\n>I wouldn't trust their statistics without *independent* verification.\n>\n>> The CDC estimates\n>> that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once\n>> in 1990.\n>\n>Based on CPHV statistics?

What is the purpose of this claim?\n>\nCharles buddy, I'm getting really tired of this.  Do you live on the planet\nMars???  As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact\nwith many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local\nurban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition\nspend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard\ngunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot,\nwhether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and\nwhether they themselves have ever been shot.\n \nBelieve me Charles, THAT will be your *INDEPENDENT* VERIFICATION.\n \n###########################################################################\nRodney W.
