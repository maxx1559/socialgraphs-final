It was the religion of the great Persian\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\nZoroastrian prophet.\n\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\npeople is very much on their minds.\n\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\n\n   \"It's important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It's important\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\nYou don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\n\n   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.\n\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\n\n_Good vs. evil_\n\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\n\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\n\n   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\n\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\nwhere others had no rights.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\nthis continent.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\ncommunity center.\n\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\n\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\n\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\nZoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\n\n  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people\ncame to worship and revel.\n\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\nproved him right.\n\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\nand nuts.\n\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\n\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\n\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\n\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\nplayed a tambourine.\n\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\n\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\npeople's religion.\n\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\n\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\n\n   \"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the\ndifference with the lower animals?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------ end of article ----",

By the\nJewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture,\nyour gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead\npeople to idol worship and away from God.

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to\n  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive\n  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS \n  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)\n\nSince it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin\nof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \"no good\"\nbecause it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not \nthe authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time \nbefore I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, \nProfessor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the \nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring \n1993 edition):\n\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\n  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn't draw\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\n  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\n  that the central pillar of Christ's \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\n\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\n\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\n\n\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\nto This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\narms.  \n\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \nvoice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand\non in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter \nthe LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths \nand non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to \ndisprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. \nLet us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion \nand conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.  \n\n \nHal Leifson -- signing off!",

In fact, for the Bible to be of\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\n\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\n\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\nwritten down by man.\n\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\nhave done).\n\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\nthink the important aspect is the result.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:\n\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\nAs they swam its clearness through.",

Good and\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\n\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\nthe Scriptures.\n\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\n\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.

In my last article I stated:\n \n> (By the way Mr DeCenso, you really should have looked in the index of your\n> Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich Greek lexicon.

I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus\nconfused \"kleros\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of\nland discussed.  In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\n1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\ncannot report as to the nuances of the word.\n \nI don't know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure that\nsomeone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating\nmistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point\"\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nMY REPLY...\nVary noble of you Dave.  I didn't want to have to go to x number of sources to\nshow you wrong.  (Although I am researching CHORION a little).\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only other reference Mr DeCenso has given is Bullinger.  And\nBullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when I accused Mr DeCenso of\nactually believing Bullinger, he replied that I misquoted him:\n \n>> \"And you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing?

I'm only responding to\n>this one you have directed re: Bullinger's views because it's enjoyable.\n \nThus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such \"drek\"\nconvincing....he should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincing\nand quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of \"This is what Bullinger\nbelieved, not necessarily what I believe.\" So which is it Mr DeCenso? Do you\nfind the exegisis convincing or not?)\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nOne of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and\nothers is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations\nraised by various Bible scholars and students alike.  When I present MY VIEWS,\nI will clearly distinguish them from now on.\n \nDB...\n\"Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented\nno Greek exegisis at all, and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not\nreferring back to the actual Greek.  Thus we find this demand on his part for\nquality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nGood point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you\nhave produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug\ndeeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on\nthese passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.\n \nDB...\n\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as\nevidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it\noften enough:\n \n> (a) the text itself\n> (b) parallel passages\n> (c) other pertinent Scriptures\n> (d) historical context\n> (e) historical content\n> (f) other pertinent historical info\n> (g) cultural context\n> (h) cultural content\n> (i) other pertinent cultural info\n> (j) grammatical construction\n> (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies\n> (l) etc.\n \nBut are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's\nsee, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other\npassages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has\npresented no use of:\n \n(d) historical context                or\n(e) historical content                or\n(f) other pertinent historical info   or\n(g) cultural context                  or\n(h) cultural content                  or\n(i) other pertinent cultural info     or\n(j) grammatical construction          or even\n(k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]\n \nThus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQuestion:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting\nto use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present\nshallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).\nAt this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a\ntotal exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating\naround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe\nit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:\nJudas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use\nseveral of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.\nIt will greatly enhance our study of these passages.\n \nDB...\n\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other\npassage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is\nred herring and his only real criteria seems to be:\n \n> (a) the text itself\n> (b) parallel passages\n \nMY REPLY...\nThe reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the\nPASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one\nanother.\n(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;\n(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look\nat your defense of this later.\n \nAlso, the \"reward of iniquity\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of\nsilver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at\nstating why you believe it is).\n \nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\nas he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\npassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's\nexplanation of Judas' death...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\n=============================================================\n \nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\nall.\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\ntrue and supplementary.\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\nthe same time.\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\ncase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\ninerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\nHere's what you said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\n> Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks\n> on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we\n>                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\n> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> was the decomposition of his body before his fall.\n \n\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so\nopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to\nfind Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\nJoslin's.\"\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHere, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for\nthe passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say\nit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it\ndidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\n \nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\nin this respect.\n \nDB...\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\n \n> (1) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas'\n>     death.  I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas\n>     died in the hanging.\n> (2) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down\n>     in the temple and the chief priests used, is the \"reward of iniquity\"\n>     in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with;\n>     therefore there is a contradiction.  Prove that the 30 pieces of silver\n>     and the \"reward of iniquity\" are one and the same.\n \nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\nis on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a\nlocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\n \nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\n \n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\nResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\nterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\n \nDB...\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention\nbelow.\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But\nhe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\ndiscover.\n \nDB...\n\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThank you, Dave.\n \nDB...\n\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nSo it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's\nposition.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?\n \nAlso, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or\ndeceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done\nwith Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including\ntheir \"interpretation\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find\nsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.\n \nYou also noted they \"interpreted\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although\nthat is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,\nthat's the first criteria we must examine.\n \nDB...\n\"This included:\n \n    \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\" by Woodward and Zuck\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nWhich I own.  It's a good source of commentary info.  But not inerrant.\n \nDB...\n    \"The Interpreters on Volume Commentary on the Bible\" by Laydon\n    \"The one volume Bible Commentary\" by J R Dunelow\n    \"Word meanings of the Testament\" Ralph Earl\n    \"The Abingdon Bible Commentary\" published by Abingdon\n    \"Harpers Bible Commentary\" by William Neal\n     (Actually I could have presented many more as well)\n \nMY REPLY...\nI appreciate your doing this research, Dave.  Maybe we are getting somewhere\nin how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depth\nstudy.\n \nDB...\n\"In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation\nof Matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus I can only conclude that the\n                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nGreek word \"apagchw\"(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nNo you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly\nprobable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.\n \nThe Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New\nTestament.\n \nIn the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\nit's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was\nnot followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his\ncity.

It is, however,\nhighly probable.                            ^^^^^^\n \nDB...\n\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had\ndifferent ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One\nsimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as\nthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\"\nsuggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly\nexploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope\nbroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain\nhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person\nwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may\nhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell\nupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a\nsuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not\ngiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted\npost gave us some...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open.\n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nDB...\nNow truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the\nsource of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is\ncorrect: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist\nwho claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to\nthereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the\nprophesy of the Potter's field came from).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nPlease, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\nthis with you.\n \nDB...\nAs to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\nmoney with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\nthan some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\nmention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\nwhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\nJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\nthat when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\ndiscusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!\n \nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\nACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\nto those who arrested Jesus;\nACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be\ndesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'\n \nNotice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\nthat Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\nBut the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\nobtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\n         ^^^^^^\nJOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a\nthief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\nJOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had\nsaid to him, \"Buy those things we need for the feast,\" or that he should give\nsomething to the poor.\n \nSo, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.\nRight after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,\naccording to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \"wages of\niniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen\nby Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical\nexplanation of what the \"wages of iniquity\" are.  What do you think, Dave?\n \nDB...\n\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you\ncould unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking\nme what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI will gladly admit that I am a Complete Inerrantist, although I do not have\nthat big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view.\n\nFrank\n-- \n\"If one wished to contend with Him, he could not answer Him one time out\n of a thousand.\"  JOB 9:3",

In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\n> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\n\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\nindeed \"chorion.\" \n\nNow I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\n\n\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \n\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\n\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \nthink it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \"contradictions\" to \nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\nto support Mr Archer's contentions). \n\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\nBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\nadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\nwhich drives the point home). \n\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\ndiscussing the \"Potter's Field.\"\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\n\t\t\t\tHenry Ward Beecher\n\t\t\t\tAmerican Clergyman\n\t\t\t\tas recorded by George Seldes",

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\nreferences though, \"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\nfurther context).  \n\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging.\" He then\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\ndenoted as the result). \n\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\n\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\n> it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \n> died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> ^^^^ \n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\n> result.\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\n\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \n\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\nhistorical source to justify it. \n\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:\n\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\n\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \n\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\nas the 30 silvers:\n\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\n> than some other source.

Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\nthe money box, but rather said:\n\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\n     it was night.\"\n\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \n\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\nthat night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.

Scum has no guilt or freedom to\nchoose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen.\nHe made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.  The same goes\nfor Dr. Gunn.\n\n: But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that\n: these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any \n: assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them,\n: raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever\n: to help these children after birth?\n: \n\nHere's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs\nof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see\nstraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious\nmoral decisions based on reality.\n\nIf a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not\nconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has\nfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned\naway from his responsibility to his wife and child.\n\nHowever, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,\nshe is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\n\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \"My\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\"\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\nIt's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\ndemons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and\nwe'll ruin it the first chance we get.\n\n: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real\n: good guess.\n: \n\nAnd, it's probably right.\n\n: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.\n: \n\nIt is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our\nresponsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media\nbacks us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only\n\"responsibility\" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just\nenough to make us \"feel responsible\" without showing anything that\nmight show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to \"feel\" like\ngood people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give\nme the freedom to say \"I'm good\", and the rest of the world can burn.\nRape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where\npoor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister\nif I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,\nbecause it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church\nbecause church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.\nBut, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love\nmyself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that\na man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too \"christian\".\n\nAt the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\n\nWe've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible\nto our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or\nto our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every\ncorruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and\nof every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will\nhave to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the\nbiggest blessing this world can hope to see.\n\nWhy do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n\t We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n\t We must reach the root of the evil...\n\t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n\t from the dreadful deed...\n\t No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n\t\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n\t\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n\t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n\t\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\"\n\n\t\t- Susan B.

This is exactly what it has become -- a far cry from\n>its original position of stature .\n\nLooking at [1] we find that during Roman times \"Tyre vied with Sidon\nfor first place in the intellectual life of the period\"; that Tyre was\nthe seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;\nthat \"the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia\" was the\nbasilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its\nexports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,\nalong with other seaports, \"provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian\nand even Chinese trade\"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing\npopulation by \"following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line\nof growth\" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre\nestablished colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a \"small\nfishing village\" by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nCenturies later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \"opulent and flourishing\nbazaars\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was\n\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\"\nDuring the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held\nby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)\n\nIn [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \"other\n*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and\nZahlah.\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of\nthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)\non the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's\nwithdrawel in 1984, \"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\neconomy.\"\n\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a \"major city\")?  Why\ndoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities\nin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the\nlist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?\n\n[1] Philip K.

By modern standards\n>we are talking about a one-horse town.\n\nA one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.\n(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They\nmay even use cars these days. :-) \n\nThe 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says \"Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.\"  \nMost other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.\n(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same\nsource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,\nso I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for\nthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the\npopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In\nparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   \n\n>> After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200's, I believe.

Sidon, for example?  Can you make\na case for Tyre having been singled out?\n\n>>Well, it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye\n>>\"Tyrian purple\" in Roman times. \n>\n>This is correct, but they were under Roman domination, and the \n>majority of the created wealth was siphoned off.

From [2]:\nTyre \"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes\nand from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a\nlarge series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\"\n\nThe descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit\nyour characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems\nto have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching\nwhen you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small\nfishing village.\n\n>Who is Josh McDowell.\n\nA Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.\nHe happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,\n_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).\nThe same sentence, in fact.

Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\nhomosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.\n\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\n\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN \"EX-GAY\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\n\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\n\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\nthrough prayer.  \"I'd like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I'm\nno longer deserve it.\"\n  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There's no reality\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\nsexuality are men.\"\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\n  \"It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it's really impossible to\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is\nabout, I don't want to be this way anymore.\"\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\nfor hell.\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\nwhere the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\nadding, \"They'll do anything to reach these people.\"\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\n  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\nRaphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\nthat I should be a 'reformed' gay person.\"\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally's\nshow,\" \"I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\n  \"I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We'd go to conferences in other cities,\nand we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\nelse.\"\n  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\n  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\nchurch and closed the ministry's doors.  \"I'd convinced myself that there\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I'm interest-\ned in belief systems that aren't judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\nmay have brought to our community.\"\n\n---end article---\n\nCaligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\nof former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\nthem, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\nMaury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\nself-acceptance.\n\nThank you.",

The\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\n\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\n\nSome personal thoughts:\n\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\nToday's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\n\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t\na clue what is in their heart.\n\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \"first-hand\" real life and\nloving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no\nless abundant.\n\nThank you.\nPAX",

I have no particular plan (except to do\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\n\nI've had some more thoughts on my definitions:\n\nI've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\nfrequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the\nspectrum over time.\n\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\ntime which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\nFreud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\nurges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\".

I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\nfall, though.\n\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\n\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\n\n>\n>The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created\n>in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever\n>moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we\n>are supposed to live by Christ's example, you would be hard pressed to\n>argue that God is a \"do what I say, not what I do\" kind of guy.\n\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created\nin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\n\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\n\n>\n>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no\n>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.\n\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:\n\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\nAs they swam its clearness through.",

You like those conclusions?\n>I don't.\n\nI think that you are changing the meaning of \"values\" here. Perhaps\nit is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.\n\nvalue n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods\nor service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in \nusefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality\nconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as\nof a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. \nThe relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or\nlightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech\nsound. \n\nIn context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms\nof scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that\nthese definitions do not mean the same thing.\n\nIn my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\nreach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the\nword \"value\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard\nof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one\nconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on\nsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a\nscientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as\n\"objective values.\"\n\nBack to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.\nJust because the word \"values\" is used in both contexts does not mean\nthat there is a relationship between the two contexts.\n\nIf one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\nfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\nthe meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\n\nSo, back to the original question:\n\nAnd objective morality is.....?\n\nIf you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will\nbe a good beginning.\n\n>-- \n>Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'\n>odwyer@sse.ie                                  from \"Hens\",  by Evelyn Conlon\n\neric",

McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\nas \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

An awful lot of the\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\nabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\n\nAnd besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.\n\n\nmathew",

Of all the \"preachers\" of \"truth\" on\nthis net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking\ncrew, with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint...\nBTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus\nto the pharisees: \"ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,\nbut your hearts are far removed from me...\"\n\n# Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created\n# and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \"granted the Mormon\n# belief...\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to\n# have been addressed.

Satan and his followers have\nrebelled against God, and are not \"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\"\nbut it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to\nseparate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of\nsalvation.\n\n#\n#        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the\n#        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \"one\";\n#        (Matthew 13:38)\n\nSo?  --This illustrates nicely what I just said: the children of the\nkingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus\n(and have shown \"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the\nwicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us\nabout \"the only true God,\" whom you interpret according to your own likes\nand dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about\nHim myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other\nfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different\nway or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission\nand progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob\nor opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited\nevery continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.\n\n#  This is really a red herring.

Or: \"what the bible teaches according to\nRobert Weiss and co.?\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\n\n(...)\n\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.'

The indication from Rick is that they may\n#  certainly be.\n\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\nas \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.

[Would I kid you?]\n\n\nDoes one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands\nof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the\nOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\ntheir original expression.\n\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\nfrom Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \nfor many years.\n\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\n\n\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\n\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \nKellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\nin Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of\nthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\nsecret of sexual magic.\n \n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\nLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\n\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\n\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\n\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'\n\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\n\n\n\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\nfor very many interpretations.\n\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\nsupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.\n\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \nWill I?  \nI think not.\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\n\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\nI do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\nthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\n\n\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\nof the organization as it stands.\n\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \nI followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\nMass well enough for my tastes.\n \n\nThis doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\nlimited contact with other members.\n\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\nand the preservation of individual vision.\n\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\nto other posts in this thread.\n\n\nInvoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.\n\nI am I!\n\nFrater (I) Nigris (DCLXVI) CCCXXXIII",

Specifically, are you saying it's these religious \nJews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy, \nrather than by faith, who won't agree?  Orthodox Jews?  \n\nAs to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains \nunproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often \nlook to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.\nFor agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so \nsure the atheists can be counted out. \n\nFor the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,\nor David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to which\none adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it\ndepends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might \nunderstand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.\n\n   |\n-- J --\n   |\n   | stephen",

By biblical scholar I mean\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\n\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\n\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\nhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\nbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\nfaith off as fact.\n\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? \nShouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \nan evolutionary ancestry).\n\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \n\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\nresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.

He is the Prophet who is revealed\nthe last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)\nthrough the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from \nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\n\n\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\n\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\n\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\n\tall things.\n\n---------------------\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\nAllah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\nan arbitrary matter.

In\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\nOur'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\neffect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\nwhile being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has\nappointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes'\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\nand more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'\n   In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger\nclaimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\nmerely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!'\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\nways.\n   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.",

The fact is, there are *two* references to\nJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least\nbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that\nJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage\nsays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the\nJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho\nfor Jesus and may be authentic.\n   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference\nto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which\nlack the references.\n\nIt is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but\nI don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in\nthe scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes\nthis position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view\nthat Jesus never existed.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920's.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know \nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, \"Storm Troopers\" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from \ntheir footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered \"shrewd guesses\"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

In other\n>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday\n>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.\n\nI think the passage you're looking for is the following.\n\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \nheaven. \nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \n\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\nimpose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\nin Acts 15.)\n\nHowever there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\nissue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\nassures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we\nlive in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.\n\nIt's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\nvalues.",

        "content": "Tony-\n\nI read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other\ntypical\"Christian\" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their 'cause' and\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\n\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\nin the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I've\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\n\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\n\nI'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\noppressive legisation against gays.\n\nPerhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\n\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\nwill 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\npeople's expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\n\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\nsomething very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\non thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\nGay people are not criminals.\n\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\n\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\nColorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\n\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\nembracing.\n\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\ntowards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\nexcluding people.\n\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,\nespecially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\nitself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\nto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\n\nWhatever\n\nRich :-(",

He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It\nisn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for\na persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your\nquestion.\n\nJesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\nwe would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\nand my faith would be vanity.\n\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\nsays why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \"The\nworld hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation\nof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\nneed a Saviour.\n\nAnd why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  \"The\nworld cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows\nhim.\"  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge\nthat comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is\nvery convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.\nI pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of\nknowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thank\nGod that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I'd also be\nbumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very\nPerson who created me and who loves me.",

From\nthis fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with\nCatholic doctrine.\n\nIs there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love\nstory between people of that faith, but a love story that is not\nexploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays\nproper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic\nenough to have a place on a.s.s.\n\nI would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also\nmost of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.\n\nI would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and\nincrease the erotica.

I count them as noise, which makes my take on the\nsignal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.\n\nSince you are one of the few posters here who can actually write \ndecent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead of\noverwhelming us with commentary?  \n\n> Anyway, this is a big subject.

Christian people have caused\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:\n\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \n\n\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\n\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\n\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\n\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\nof the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\nperson's life creates a new situation to which morality must be\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's\n\"objective\" morality for us. \n\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \n\n\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\n\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\n\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\n\t'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall\n\tbe liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is\n\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\n\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\nseeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\nwas/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\nmorality.\" \n\nJohn Nunnally",

S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \"Love is the unfamiliar Name\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\"\n\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\n\n>As a non-believer, I find Michael's Christianity kinder and gentler.\n\nblechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \"sin\" on\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\n\n>If I take him at\n>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were\n>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If\n\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\n\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\nprohibitions.\n\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\n\n\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\n\t    in the Inquisition.\n\n\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\n\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\n\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\n\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\n\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\n\n\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\n\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\n\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\n\n\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\n\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\n\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\nof charges brought against them.)\n\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don't think that\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\nthe gospel, as if one's theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\nJesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\n\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow\n>man?) And what is the \"right thing\"?  And how does one go about\n>loving god? \n\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\nthey *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\"\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\n\n>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo\n>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the\n>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.\n\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\nIt does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\n\n\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\n\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\n\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll\n\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\n\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\n\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\nsystem.\n\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\n\n>I am glad that a few Christians,\n>such as Michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then\n>interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive\n>fashion.

Literally. There is\n     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible\n     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\n\n          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the \n          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];\n          (Matthew 13:38)\n\n          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which \n          ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)\n\n          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not \n          born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said \n          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I \n          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he \n          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye \n          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the \n          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the \n          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in \n          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\n\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)\n\n          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this \n          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit \n          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)\n\n          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the \n          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he \n          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)\n\n     One becomes a child of God...\n\n          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\n          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)\n\n          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that\n          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us\n          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,\n          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when\n          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he\n          is. (1 John 3:1-2)\n\n     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:\n\n          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of\n          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)\n\n          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus\n          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,\n          (Ephesians 1:5)\n\n          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should\n          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)\n\n          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of\n          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;\n          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,\n          Father.

The fact that some groups try to read \n     something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For \n     example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ \n     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \"Looking for that blessed hope,\n     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\n     Christ;\" (Titus 2:13),\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus\n     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through\n     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\" (2 Peter 1:1)] \n     on the Deity of Christ.\n\n     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not \n     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that \n     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, \n     you have to look at the Bible.\n\nra> >     \"Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation\" (_The\nra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \"He had to work out his own salvation by\nra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\" (ibid., p.54), \"he had\nra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\" (_Mormon\nra> >     Doctrine_, p.71).\nra>\nra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

The conclusions I come to may seem \"heretical\" to\nra> you, but I'm prepared to accept that.\n\n     I find this rather curious. When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is\n     that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late\n     apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the\n     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \"I\n     have my own conclusions\" to addressing the point.\n\n     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n     issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n     subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may \n     certainly be.\n\n\n=============================\nRobert Weiss\npsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu",

O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\nestablished in the self.\n  \n                                PURPORT\n\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\nbeginning of transcendental life.\n\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\n\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\nBooks of A.C.

I have seen numorous postings on the net\non this subject, and all they say, \"No, NO, you cannot use ISLAM as \nthe name of your newsgroup\". ?? \n\nI haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring\nthe name of other's faiths? Who gives them this authority? Quran? or\nHadith? or something else?

I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single \nsuch evidence from the history of Islam!\n\nHence, if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone, how\ncould the Muslims, Mullahs or even Governments of today do\nit to anyone.

I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,\nand for trying to \"explain me away\" without addressing the objections\nI raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank\nby accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.)

Since the responsibility \nfor understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that \nGod in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source \nfor that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink. \n \n>>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no\n>>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.\n \n>No. There may be an absolute moral code.

You might have said \"burp\", for burping and swearing carry\nabout the same stigma today.  If you are talking about \"taking the Lord's \nname in vain\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of \nhypocrisy than of varying moral codes.\n \nIf there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply\nabsolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes\ncould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for\nexample, God's code could include, \"Thou shalt not create Beings without\na hospitable planet to live on\", but this law would be inapplicable to us.\nNevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable\nto us are also applicable to God.\n \nBut when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have\na sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to\nfollow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category \"morality\"\ncan be sensibly applied.\n-- \n                                     James Owens  ad354@Freenet.carleton.ca\n                                     Ottawa, Ontario, Canada",

Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and\nLucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or\norganized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being \"offspring\" of\nGod has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \"born again\" of\nHim.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.

Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]\n>Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really\n>busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!\n\nHe directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of\nresponse to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.\n\nI pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and\nJim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to\nunderstand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't\nhave time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote\nout of context.  \n\nI asked Jim the following:\n>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for\n>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a\n>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?\n\nJim replied by saying \n>Did I either ask or assert that?\n\nBut today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject\n\"Silence is concurrence\":  \n\nm23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes:\n>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of\n>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual\n>may be held responsible for that action?\n\nWhich is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of\ncontext isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on\nt.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.\n\nDoes \"silence is concurrence\" imply that Jim thinks that because I\ndidn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes\nout of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this\nquestion; read what he has written and decide for yourself.\n\n\nBut back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next \ngambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he\nconcluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide\nthe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\nToday we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help\nmake it more clear, Jim), titled \"Inductive Logic\":\n\n>Scenario:\n>A white goose waddles past the door\n>A white goose waddles past the door\n>A white goose waddles past the door\n>...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)...\n>A black goose waddles past the door.

If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question \n>   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese?\n\nMore red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\nnumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \"axed\" his articles,\nbut not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\nWell, I can't see where he is going with this.\n\nBut I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80\narticles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with\nFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that\nthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt\nwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man\nargument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)\n\nThink hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it\nthrough your induction engine and see what pops out.  \n\ndj",

He called them \"the Great Commission\" but this is NOT\ndescriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.\n\nMatt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:\n\n\t\"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have\n\tto say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust\n\tfrom your feet.\"\n\nMatt. 10:15:\n\n \t\"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not \n \tgo as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with \n \tthat town.\"\n\nIn the post to which Dean is referring above, I said:\n\n\"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on\n > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.\"\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^\n\nThe highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.\n\nAnd Dean countered:\n\n\"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an\nintellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I\nspecifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty\nto spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two\nstatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to\ncharacterize that as \"ignoring\" the instruction to spread the\nword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\"\n\nOf course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \"instruction\nto spread the word.\"\n\nAll these quotes btw are from:\n\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>\n\n>in which, at the end, he claims I did not answer a question\n>which I answered, and which he deleted (to get the chronology\n>right, he deleted the answer and then said I didn't answer).\n\nAnd I claim it correctly, because my question went:\n\n\"Do you, too, measure\nthe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not\na whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\"\n\nand the closest Dean came to an answer was:\n\n\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,\nand generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that\nthe sport is all there is.\"\n\nOf course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts\nin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,\nyet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:\n\n\"So I now restore the answer to your question\nthat you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask\na nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really\ndoesn't take much sophistication to understand.\"\n\nOn top of which, I doubt that the \"answer\" is at all representative\nof Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's \nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\nOne wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all\nthis.\n\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\n\n\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\n\t\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nthe \"sins\" of other individuals.\"\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\n\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\n\nDean again:\n\n\"You made an ass of yourself\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\n\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\n\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\n\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\nthe basis of one insult after another.\n\nPeter Nyikos",

And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian\nbrother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at \nall, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?

        "subject": "THE DIVINE MASTERS",
        "content": "THE DIVINE MASTERS       \n      \n               Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that \n          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God \n          into the physical world, God Incarnate. \n          \n               But there are some very important related facts that \n          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of \n          most other world religions. \n           \n               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-\n          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \n          after the life of Jesus. \n    \n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \n          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \n          teaching of REincarnation. \n       \n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \n          UNIVERSES.)                             \n\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \n      \n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \n          indicator for religious validity. \n    \n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \n          other major world religions, including Islam. \n     \n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \n          \"silver cord\". \n    \n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of \n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \n          Master. \n    \n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \n    \n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \n          Mat\" organization. \n      \n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \n    \n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \n          classic. \n    \n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \n          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \n          Jesus was. \n    \n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \n          Master. \n    \n          \n    \n          RE-INCARNATION\n          \n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \n          \n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \n          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, \n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \n          INCARNATION. \n\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \n\n\n\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\n\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \n          waiting for Jesus' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \n    \n          \n          \n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\n\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \n    \n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \n    \n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \n          \n          \n          \n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\n\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \n       \n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \n          CONTINUE. \n    \n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \n          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \"SOUL TRAVEL\") \n          REPLACE blind faith. \n    \n\n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (3 books, 2 addresses). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \n\n\n                                           Robert E.

        "content": "There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among\nSouthern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and\nI suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily\nagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.\n\n *\n\nFor a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book\nclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.\n(Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the\nMasons.)\n\nThe SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,\nwhich studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\nfeeling that they were saying \"You got the wrong answer last time, try to\ndo better and get the answer we want.\")\n\nAnyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\nsuch as: \"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\"\n\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\nof Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Examples of\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\nare not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\naren't really in a place to speak on this last point.)\n\n\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\ninfluenced how the report came out.\n\n *\n\nThe information above was gleaned from \"The Religious Herald\", a publication\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \"Baptists Today\", which\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a\nbig issue among some Baptists.  8-)\n\nBecause I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are\nrelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.  Your\nmileage may vary.  Void where prohibited.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\nMilton:  \"We use only the finest baby frogs, dew picked and flown from Iraq,\n          cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then\n          sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk\n          chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose.\"\n\nPraline: \"That's as may be, it's still a frog.\"",

        "content": "In article <1746.2BD37A66@paranet.FIDONET.ORG> \nBill.Carlson@p0.f18.n104.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Bill Carlson) writes:\n> Since everywhere I look, Zoroaster is suggested as being a probable\n> descendant of Daniel; suppose you prove he wasn't.\n\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\n\nMAGI: \n\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\n\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \n(Gershevitch, 1964).\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\nhierarchy.\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\nof Central Asia.\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\nthat of the priesthood: white.\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\nmaster of himself.\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\npriesthood, would be very strange.\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\n\nSAOSHYANT:\n  The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\nstate of the world, when existence will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\"\n[See Frashokereti]\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (\"he who embodies truth\"), the son of\nthe Vispataurvairi (\"she who conquers all\"), is the third, who will make\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he who makes\ntruth grow,\" and Ukhshyatnemah, \"he who makes reverence grow\"; the names of the\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\nits roots to the same source.",

I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.\n\tThe official side has its advocates already; lets balance the\n\tequation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake\n\tof an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:\n\n\t\tinnocent until proven guilty.\n\tnot\n\t\tinnocent until presumed guilty.\n\n\t1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.\n\n\t\tDon't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard\n\t\tequipment.\n\n\t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?\n\n\t\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This\n\t\t  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable\n\t\t  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.\n\n\t\t\t.... gotcha!\n\n\t\t  ... when in isolation from other substances.\n\n\t\t  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote\n\t\t  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \"this window,\n\t\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come\n\t\t  down\", and maintain a left to right sequence?\n\n\t\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when\n\t\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)\n\t\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to\n\t\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long\n\t\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend\n\t\t  to ignite.\n\n\t\t\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics?\n\t\t\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?\n\n\t\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation\n\t\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made\n\t\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature\n\t\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain\n\t\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length\n\t\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).\n\n\t\t\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes.\n\t\t\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),\n\t\t\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why\n\t\t\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open\n\t\t\tto the outside?).\n\n\t\t\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the\n\t\t\tcompound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones\n\t\t\tare missing?\n\n\tDo I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.\n\tYou trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?\n\t\tIN advance of a Court?  God help us.\n\t\t\t(For we are surely not helping ourselves).\n\tYou trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?\n\n\t\tYou are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.\n\t\tLook again.\n\n\tDid it happen that way?

As the punctilious scholars have written\nmany volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,\nhere we will briefly point out only the general category\ninto which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted\nas accurate reports.\n    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad\n(SAW) fall into two main categories:  \n\n    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal \nevents that happened at the time of his birth, or before his \ndeclaration of prophethood.  \n\n    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences \nof the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: \n\n    1) Those wonders that were manifested after\nhis departure from this world in order to confirm his\nprophethood, and \n\t2) Those that he exhibited during the era\nof his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  \n\t2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest\nin his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral\nconduct and perfection, and \n    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  \nThe last part again has two branches:  \n\t2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and \n\t2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last \nbranch is again divided into two categories:  \n\t2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings \nthat occured during his mission either to break the \nstubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the\nfaith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different\nsorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of\nwater from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with\na little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals\nEach of these sons has also many instances, and thus\nhas, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by\nconsensus.  \n\t2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this\nincludes events lying in the future that occured as he had\npredicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting\nfrom the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)\n\n(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended\nwithout choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could\nnot completely conform to the order of this classification.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.",

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll\ntry to get better.\n\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\n\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\nhis set of excuses.  \n\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\n\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see\nthe dialog:\n\n\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \n\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\n\nBK:  \"No.\"\n\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\n     the oncoming truck.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\n\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\n\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\n\n\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \n\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\n\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\nBrian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \n\nThank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.

What Peter says about God is what\nthe Bible says.   \n\n\nConsider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of\nyears, various people come up and testify of their experience with the\nliving God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,\nonce the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes\nDavid, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King \nNebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes\nNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent\ntakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use\nto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up\ncomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.\nUp comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS\nagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years\nwith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself\n\"I am.\" \n\nWhile you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that\nKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known\nMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these\npeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet\nall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells\nof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is\ndifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly\nreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.\nWhat Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of\nBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different\nperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\ndares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's\ntestimony, even though different from those prior, consistently\ndescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  \n\nNow.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic\non the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  \"I am\".  He has\nrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).\nPlease believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.\n\nAre you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \nAre you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\nshepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\nprogrammers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\ncomplete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\nthat is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\ndisplay of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\nKing Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincolnr?",

Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never\ndemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he\njust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of\ncommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.\n\nBut even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the\nverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,\nwhich is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only\nhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all\nstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with\nthat: substitute \"Moslem\" or \"Buddhist\" or \"Satanist\" instead of\n\"Christian\", and it means the same thing.\n\nChristanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.

Hopefully, you won't\nget flamed, either.\n\nYou will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is\nbuilt on unsteady ground.\n\nFirst, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \"objective morality\". \nMorality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a\nperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even\noverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.\n\n> Assumptions:\n> \n> (1) A Christian bedrock assumption that all that is True, comes\n> Truly from God. \n> \n> (2) Regarding alt.sex.stories.

If, as you say,\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\nusing the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.\n \n> In the long run, the advantage of making such a literary/moral\n> analysis is that it will save band-width between Christians and\n> non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of\n> the stuff on these (pornographic) groups.\n\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\nall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the\nreligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,\noverbearing totalitarianists?\n \n> Basically, there should not be a dissonance between a \"Christian\"\n> morality and a \"non-Christian\" one.  Either there is value in a\n> particular work, or there is not whether one is a Christian or\n> not.\n\nHm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to\ndiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I\nstart off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\nhave their faces uncovered.\n\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \n                                                                         \n> In support for the first assumption:\n> \n> The Christian scriptures say this:\n\n\t(Evidence deleted)\n\nI'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \"The Word\nof God\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for\na person who shares your beliefs.\n\nStill, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could\nbe interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.\n\n>                                                                        \n>              **************************************\n> \n> NOW THEN what are some of the major themes/motifs in the\n> pornographic literature on places like alt.sex.stories?

There\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \n\n> But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\n> society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?

These commandments\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\ncriticizing ethical systems.

There are *many*\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \n\n-*----\n> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \nseriously.

It tells us that the New Testament\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\nshouldn't do. \n\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\nmake Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\nChristian interpretation.  \n\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\nlukewarm we should spit out. \n\nRussell",

They had advertised that\nthey were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the room\nof the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went to\nthe lecture.\n\nThere were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one\nwoman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of\nthem. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read\nstraight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he\nlacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy\nread, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The\nfirst guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and\nthat they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars\n(English?) from the thirteenth century.\n\nThe other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a\nfairy-tale teller's voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to\nme. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something.\nWhat made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all\ncontained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,\nthen that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,\nbut if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I've\nread too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks\nabout in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your\nfriends_ in _Prometheus rising_. \n\nIt was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding\nthe actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to\nbe a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more\ndistance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain\npower and admiration. He spoke like a fairy-tale teller, whenever he\nremembered. ;)\n\nThe information brochure is at home.

Whether or not there is some \"right\"\ninterpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to\nread the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it was\nMichael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural\ninfluence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, but\nregardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point\nof contention between Michael and myself. \n\nI have argued -- beyond Michael's claims -- that the Christian\nscriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a\nwide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their\nmost important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that\nthere is some \"right\" interpretation *unless* there is a way to\ndetermine what that \"right\" interpretation is.  It is the lack of\nan objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that\nputs the force behind the line I argue.\n\n> Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian\n> glasses.

He is willing to live and practice his religion\nwithin this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that\nmuch of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by\nideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have\ncalled conservative must also interpret, but they do not\nrecognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and\nimportance of this.\n\n> Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's\n> theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;\n> Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?'

A surprising logical ellipsis.\n\nI think the conclusion does follow.  The purely Christian\nprinciples that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in\nthe Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian\nscripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his\npolitical stances.  That one should love one's neighbor is a \npurely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance \nfor homosexuality is *not*.\n\nAs to these political stances, they are often at odds with what\nis commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I \nsuspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other\nhand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these \npolitical stances become most influential when presented to \nthose who need them most.)\n\n-*----\n> This is a theological statement worthy of Barth.\n> Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)\n\nHaving barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I\ndoubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!\n\nRussell",

We do them regardless.  \n\nKent Sandvik responds:\n\n> Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you \n> have to feel guilty . . . \n\nI think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn't view\nguilt like our modern venacular colors it.   \n\n\"Feelings\" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of \nbeing guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a \nreaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the \nreaction.   Let me give you an example:\n\nHave you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a\nlittle white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really \ndidn't know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?\nAre you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You\nare guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  \nFeelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus's use of the word\n\"guilt\" as how a court uses it.\n\nJesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being\nimperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do\nbad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our \nguilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. \nWe are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is\nnot a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us\nsinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a\nhuman being.  Guilty as charged.\n\n> and then there's this single personality that will save you from this\n> universal guilt feeling.\n\nYou can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you\nmade a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in\nthe meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the\nway Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.\n\nOr two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself\nand feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to\nsay a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way \nJesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this \ncategory to some extent in their lives.\n\nJesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt\nfeeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he\nloves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That\nisn't new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize \nthat this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.\nThat is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to \nhave your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.\nJesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present\nsinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  \n\nGod is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into\na round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to\nchange our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.\nGod has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in\nJesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will\nmove it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very\nbeing--and us and God communicate with each through his\nunifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For\nwith the divine nature living within us, we can now see\nour imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With\nthe power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power\nto help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives \nwithin us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before\nwe could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now \nhave authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine \nnature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit\nis eternal.\n\nThe relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because\nit is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to\nheavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.\nRemember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he\nseparated the \"goats from the sheep\".   Many people in the\nlast day will ask him, \"Didn't I prophesy in your name and do\nmiracles, and do good things in your name?\"   And what did Jesus say?\n\"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.\"  That is the cornerstone of \nChristianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your \nrelationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will\nbe counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  \n\n> Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,\n> I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this\n> huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.\n\nGood.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you\nlove yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus\ntaught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, \nin the common english venacular, \"feeling guilty\" has a\ndifferent meaning than the state of guilt.\n\n> This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain\n> personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain\n> religious doctrines. And if your personality type is \n> opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain\n> world view system.\n\nI believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,\na lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.\n\n> There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice\n> thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,\n> the shoulders feel far more relaxed!\n\nYes.  You have stated what Jesus said.  Remember?  \"Come to me,\ntake my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light.\"  A yoke\nis used to direct oxen to do work.  Once you have a relationship with \nJesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life.  Having \nGod at your side is of great advantage.",

        "subject": "Objectivity (was: After 2000 years...)",
        "content": "This discussion on \"objective\" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the\nrecent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually\nobserve phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is\n\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\nand the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\ndefinition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\n\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\n    observable phenomenon.\n\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \n\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\n\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \n\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\nmanner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone's face,\"\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\nmorality. \n\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\nevidence.\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    In starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one's\n    point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be\n    simple and dignified.\n\t\t\t\tDiogenes",

It is also called the sin against\nthe Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative\nones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same.\nI'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't\nknow what you mean by \"That He needed to be saved\".  Jesus?\nJehovah?  Elohim?

Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\nHeaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\nobsolete by Jesus.\n\nIf anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\nfollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\nthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He\nalso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived\ninterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their\nheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness\nmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom\nof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their\nway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.\nThey had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the\nletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  \n\nI think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\nmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\nin it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nChristianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\nperspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\nSome people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their\nchoice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\n\nGod be with you,\n\nMalcolm Lee  :)",

I know\nyour Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did,\nbut I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has\nany bearing on this universe or the lives in it, and I similarly do\nnot believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed.\n\nPeriod.\n\nI view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a 'cultural\nvirus' that has been passed down from generation to generation because\npeople are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim\nresponsibility for their own fate, so they brainwash themselves and\ntheir children into believing the popular myths, and it goes on from\nthere.  And eventually Christianity becomes a given -- if so many\nother people believe in it, it must be right, no?\n\nI don't believe in any \"life after death\".  I believe that when I die,\nI die, so therefore it's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose\nto my life in the meantime.  I don't believe that it's a good thing to\nhumble myself and view pride as a sin -- pride, in moderation, is a\nconstructive thing.  I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and\nnothing inferior about women, and my priests lost a lot of my trust\nwhen they patronizingly tried to explain the 'faults' of these\nopinions to me.  I don't believe in 'loving everyone', especially\npeople I've never met; while I try to show respect to everyone, my\nlove and admiration is something not easily earned, and I do not feel\nguilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has\nabused it.\n\nIf you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously, stop\ntrying to show me how the Bible \"makes sense\".  Start trying to show\nme that this Jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone's life\nhere on Earth.\n\n-- \n_/_/_/  Brian Kendig                             Je ne suis fait comme aucun\n/_/_/  bskendig@netcom.com                de ceux que j'ai vus; j'ose croire\n_/_/                            n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent.\n  /  The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre.\n /    is that it ends.                                           -- Rousseau",

In most cases, the dictionary is the standard\nI use. Here is a definiton of objective:\n\nobjective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \ndistinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance.\n3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\nobservable phenomenon.\n\nBy this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the\nphrase \"objective worth\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a \nlittle differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a\nnotion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is\nresponsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and\nthus \"objective\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.\nHowever, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is \n\"good\") is subjective.\n\nI think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time\nand read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth,\nvalue, morality, good, evil.

Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\n\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\n\n\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\n\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\n\n\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\n\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\n\n\nAnd in John 3:16:\n\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\n   life.\"\n\n\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.\n\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\n\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\n\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\n\n-------------------------------\nBrian Ceccarelli\nbrian@gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu",

The THEORY of evolution represents the\nscientific attempt to explain the FACT of evolution.  The theory of evolution\ndoes not provide facts; it explains facts.  It can be safely assumed that ALL\nscientific theories neither provide nor become facts but rather EXPLAIN facts.\nI recommend that you do some appropriate reading in general science.

        "content": "-*----\nIn article <C5ztJu.FKx@news.cso.uiuc.edu> cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb) writes:\n> Why is the NT tossed out as info on Jesus.  I realize it is \n> normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what\n> are the other reasons?\n\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\nascribes this more broadly.\n\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\nthis way by a critical reader.\n\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\nit bit him on the keister twice.\n\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\nauthor's history of whatever.)\n\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\nthe text provide evidence?\n\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\nthan teach history.\n\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's \"Historian's Fallacies\"\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\nto read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy\nto read.  Give it a try.\n\nRussell",

I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in\nany Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word \"Rosicrucian\" in the \nname of the organization. I only claim having done some \"homework\" :-)\n\n     This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems\ndifferent, it's my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else.

I took me a long time to come\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\nsome 'rosicrucians' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves\nrosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\n\n     I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\n\n     Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they\ndescend (at least in part) from what was the \"Gold-und-Rosenkreuz\" (Golden\nand Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two \"Golden and Rosy\nCross\", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with\nMasonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).\n\n     \"You'll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \n\n>The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and\n>that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars\n>(English?) from the thirteenth century.\n>\n     Again, instead of R:s, it should be \"Lectorium Rosicrucianum\" :-). It\nis curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-\nsectarian*.\n\n     The Cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged\nthe 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the\n12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the\ncrusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the\nworldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church's\nunseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northern\nItaly, then throughout the south of France.\n\n\n>What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all\n>contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,\n>then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,\n>but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss.\n\n     I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with \"us containing\nsomething divine\"...

This is true in\nexactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in\nZeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophies\nfrom many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same\nway as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts.\nAtheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians\nbase theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.\n\nThe \"weak atheist\" position is logically extremely assailable -- any\nlogical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it\nas soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak\natheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with\nattempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail\nmiserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the\n\"strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist\" position do so on this\nbasis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments\npresented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound;\ntherefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do\nnot exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are\ndefined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of\npopular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite\nquestionable. \n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.

Did your style start feeling a\n>bit cramped?\n\nYes, that's exactly what I felt.  My heart just felt that what I was\nbeing taught was *wrong* -- a basically good message, but framed in\nerrors.  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were\nsomehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are \"guilty\" of their\nlifestyle, that pride in one's work is a bad thing, that Jesus died\nfor me -- I don't want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an\nimpersonal act where the person can't possibly even *know* me well\nenough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not.\n\nI was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good\nthing.  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message\nof Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I'm just not compatible with\nChristianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I\ncan't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you\ndescribe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.\n\n>I know how that goes.  Knowing I couldn't and didn't want to \n>live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me\n>outside, too.  \n\nDon't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I\ndon't believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder --\nnot because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren't*\nin my character.  You may think there's nothing keeping me from just\nrunning around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I'm able,\ninsulting people for the heck of it, because I'm not answerable to\nanyone; but you'd be wrong.  I'm answerable to myself.  A life like\nthat would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.\n\n>'Till I met the Man, that is.\n\nMy initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching\nand a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of\nGod with me.  I finally decided that I had once \"felt\" this presence\njust as I had \"felt\" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a\nlittle tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I\nhad believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as\nsomething of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.\n\nSince then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your\nsupernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in\nmy darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for\na moment and called out to whatever's out there, because I want to\nknow the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I\nhave not yet received an answer.\n\n>= Only when I truly listened to myself, body and soul, did I realize\n>= that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being\n>= Christian.  There is a higher truth in the universe, and Christianity\n>= just ain't it.\n>\n>Any suggestions on what (or who or where) it might be, and why?\n\nNope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the\nuniverse may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional\nuniverse may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same\nway you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional\nsphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts\non this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four-\ndimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck\nin a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables\nbecome too much for us to even speculate on.\n\nThat is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to\nbe, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor\nhad anything to do with it.\n\n>\"OK,\" you may say. \"So now, if I'm just being good, am I doing good enough?\"\n>\n>That's for you to answer.  If you feel you're doing fine, then go ahead and\n>ignore us foolish little Christians.  We can present what we've seen and\n>experienced (providing our witness), but it isn't up to us to make that seed\n>sprout.  \n\nChristians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy\nbook, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt\ntrips, insinuations that I'm without morals, arguments from disbelief\n(\"how can you possibly believe that God *doesn't* exist?\"), and so\nforth.  All I'm asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced,\nbut it's not going to be easy.\n\n>So much as you don't like what we're \"selling\", there just may be someone\n>out there that can identify with it.  Methinks you could give us all a \n>lesson in tolerance and back off.\n\nHaving had years upon years of contact with your religion from both\nthe inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It\npreys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it's\ngot these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly\nintolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you'll say\nthat your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judge\nChristianity from the Christians I know.\n\nI feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's\nself, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason\nthan that.\n\nSo I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some\npeople think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly\nvalid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity\nwhatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to\nrealize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy,\nfulfilled life.\n\nI have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice\nthings.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses\nis that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and\nthey know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to\nbelieve, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think\nany less of people who don't agree with them.\n\n>Obviously, the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the\n>Christian's faith is far from conclusive, notwithstanding how vehemently we\n>propose otherwise.\n\nPrecisely my point.

There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship.\nParents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that \nchildren can do whatever they want?  NOT!  Part of being a parent means\nadministering punishment when the child is at fault.  Part of being a \nparent means giving instruction.  God tests us through the trial of\nlife such that we may grow stronger.  He teaches what is right and \nwhat is wrong.  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us,\nbe it Heaven or be it Hell.  If God did not follow through with what\nHe has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent.\n\nIn parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through\nwith it, the children will not take that parent's words very seriously.\nGod does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and\nwhat not to do.  By life's trials, we see the folly of doing our own\nwill rather than His.  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting\nHim when it comes time for Judgement.

        "content": "I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and\nthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their\nstupidity and lies.    \n\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\n\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \nwondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\nFirst, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\ndidn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\nit.\n\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\n\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\nsaid:\n\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise\nDavid Koresh.\"\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\npart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE.

The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as\nofficers and yelling \"Police\" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug\nhouses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and\ndisplay of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it's\na sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even\nfight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so\ncommonly, now would it?\n\nWhether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my\npoint, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear\njudgement on this issue.\n\nI merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day.\nFurthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending\npotentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police\nalways knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have\nbeen allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  Just what should the police do\nwhen apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they\nreasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which\ncan't be faked by the \"competition\"?\n\nEven if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not an\nexcuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD's, there was almost definitely\nat most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops.\n-- \n*Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)\t*       ___\n*\t\t\t\t\t* _____/_o_\\_____\n*\tTwinkle, twinkle, little .sig,\t*(==(/_______\\)==)\n*\tKeep it less than 5 lines big.\t* \\==\\/     \\/==/",

I never said that the Law was made\n: obsolete by Jesus.\n\nJust for reference, here's the earlier quote:\nMalcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9\nand Deuteronomy 22:20-25:\n: These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had\n: expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a\n: direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God\n: is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately\n: punishable.\n: Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to\n: God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in\n: the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There\n: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And\n: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew\n: and Gentile alike.\n\nThese are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the\nother is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on\nan issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change\nwas made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus\nchange that?\n\n: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\n: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\n: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.\n\nSure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning\nnon-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to\ndeny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?\n\n: I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\n: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\n: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nI'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible\nfrom end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this\nknowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and\nback it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David\nKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if\nthey actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly\nmade the means look frightening.\n\nHowever, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but\nbelieve every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far\nmore of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy\nto manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough\nto debate with these people.\n\n: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\n: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\n\nNo, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told\nme how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will\nby doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to\nobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to\ntwo millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it\nwith my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing\nthe will of God.\n\n: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is\n: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\n\nWell, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about\neternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from\nthe god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.\n\n: God be with you,\n\nNot yours, thanks ;)\n\n: Malcolm Lee  :)\n\nRob Lanphier\nlanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu\nlanph872@uidaho.edu\n\nAnd for the curious, here is my earlier post:\n> Hmm, for a book that only applied to the Israelites (Deuteronomy), Jesus sure\n> quoted it a lot (Mt 4: 4,7,10).

        "content": "Why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to Christians, why do *we*)\nwant to find \"commandments\" in the books regarded as scripture?  What's\ngoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\nenough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\n\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\n\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\n\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\n\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\nevangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\n\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\n\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\n[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\n\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\nhow it was said: 'You must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy.  But I\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\ndoes NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\nChristians.\n\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\neven (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don't\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\n\nLet's move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\n\"equivalent\" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\n\n\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\n\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\n\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\n\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\nour understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\n\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\n\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\n\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew's\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\nof the synoptic tradition?\n\nI'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into \nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]\n-- \nMichael L.

The problem with a \"moment of\nsilence\" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of \"allowing\" for religion\namongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need\nmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are\nrequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also\nhas requirements that are not addressed by this.\n\nThere is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in\nthis \"moment of silence\" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that\nChristian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \nbeing able taking note of it.)\n\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\n\"mainstream\" religion.\n\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\ndoesn't NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\n\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\non non-Christians.\n\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, I\nsuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --\nit is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in \"making\"\ntheir children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach\nwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in\nthe world to do so.\n\nIf you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of\nsilence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment\nwill only embarrass you.  Give it up.\n-- \nMichael L.

Jesus is not soloing you out.\nJesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.\nChristians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian \nis just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian \ncan see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought\nout into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been\nexposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't\nseen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been\nexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your\nown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the\nHoly Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can\nshine light into places inside us where we didn't even know\nexisted. \n\nSo do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians\nare not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the\nLight of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,\nand they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far\nwe have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to\nknow how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants\nto know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth,\nwhich do you choose?\n\n>I'm watching the news about a man who saw the light, and made\n>sure that the 19 children burned to death as part of his insight\n>into the light. I don't think the world is that simple. And if \n>you act in such ways when you are enlighted, then I'm a happy\n>man and I pray I will never receive such 'light'.\n\nAnd I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, \nwho made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part\nof his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who\ndied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was\ntheir downfall to death. \n\nAnd Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an\nexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.\nDavid Koresh was no light and no excuse for\nyou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who\nclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh\nwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\n\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\nKoresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \n\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\nmother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\nright from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.\nThey wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\ncost them a lot.\n\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\ndidn't work with Jesus.  \n\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\nKoresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?\nWho was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what\nSatan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did\nnot Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not\nthe cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew\nthe real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve\nchoose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and\nevil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God\nheld them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None \nof them had an excuse.  \n\nAs opposed to the Branch Davidians, we have a second chance.\nFollow Jesus and he will escort us to the path of eternal life.\nDon't follow Jesus, and you stand condemned already, for like\nthe Branch Davidian complex, your house is already on fire.\nSatan, Adam and Eve have already set it ablaze.   It is just\na slow burn, but it is burning nevertheless.",

This \"disobedience\"\n#>brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from\n#>their lands and settlements...\n#\n#It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by\n#\"average\" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty\n#homogeonously Christian. It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust\n#at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.\n\nTrue, but that is exactly the \"problem\": the Mormon extermination order\nwas issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution\nof the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents\nlike this \"order\" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in\nan earlier posting, your \"irrational hatred\" is clearly evidenced by\nindividuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant;\nhe would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day\noccurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,\nlies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.\n\nIn intent and purpose, what really has changed?\n\n#The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings\n#and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them\n#are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and\n#perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification\n#which discourages critical thought.\n\nTrue, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you're aware.\n\n#>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and\n#>I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their\n#>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from\n#>being trusted or righteous.

In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church\n#>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-\"Peace Keeper\"\n#>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another \"inspired\" decision from\n#secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough\n#for the feds to back off.\n#\n#Do you mean that the \"secular authorities\" are some continuous group of\n#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the\n#Mormons?

In addition, we believe that the adversary\nhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be\na good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and\nevil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the\ndestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?\n\nAs far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples\nof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have\nbrought death, disease, (i.e. the \"downwinders\") and environmental contami-\nnation.  I am hardly \"paranoid,\" I am just not \"expecting\" too much from a\nsecular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed\n(as Gov.

As a matter of\nfact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)\npersecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that\n(paraphrasing) \"all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must\nflee to Zion.\"  Zion (the \"pure in heart\") will be re-established in those\ndays, and it AIN'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it...\n\n#>...

The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.\n#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBy \"they,\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most of\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like it\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\nappears, those of David Koresh.\n\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The\n\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\n\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\n\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\n\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\n\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\n\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\n#\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\n\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn't \"splinter\"\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\n\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\n\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\n\n#\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I'm taking it with a salt block.\n\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\n\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\n\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\nof honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\n\n#        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\n\nA good explanation, I can accept that.

But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some \nreferences.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where \nLane Fox writes, \"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' \ncareer] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\"\n\nIn my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21\nApril 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine \nPagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \"A comment *attributed* to\nJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\n\nSo far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: \n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \nI don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\norginally developed (does anyone?).\n\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The\nformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and\nideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I \ndidn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to\nincorporate theology).\n\nCan't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before \nGutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one \nhand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,\nbecause anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is \ncertainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have \nthe two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic \nms.  But here the ms. date is critical.\n\n:-)\n\nRich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota",

I'm asking because this whole thread got started\nbecause I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,\nbasically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.

It is the existence of mechanisms, not \nthe things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered \nfact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle \nsystems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original \npoint, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only \nthe mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_\natoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough\nto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being \nany clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:\n\n   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)\n      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational\n        evidence (your way)\n\n   2. --creation is just an opinion.

        "content": "There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\n\nThis doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?\"\n\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\nit is not.\n\n\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\nJohn E King:\n\n> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the\n> area[.]\n\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\nbe rebuilt\", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\nto get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\npopulation' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\n\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\n\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\nit is hardly a `clear implication'.\n\n\nMr King also writes:\n\n> So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\n> Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards\n> we are talking about a one-horse town.\n\nWell, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\nit's at least a two-horse town.\n\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it's still 22,000 people\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\n\n\nAnd you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\n\nLet's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\n\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\n\n *\n\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\n\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\n\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\nwalls.\n\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\"[Do] You know why I'm the enabler?

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is\n> the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?\n\nOK, here's at least one Christian's answer:\n\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\nGod's purposes.\n\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \n\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\n\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \nJesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \nGod's Law.\n\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\n\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \nLaw in this way:\n\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \nin Christ Jesus.\n\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \nserved it's purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \nas Christ said he would do.\n\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\nre-expressed in Christianity. \n\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and \nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \nrepresenting Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\nThe Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\nActs 20:7)\n\nOK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\n\nPlease excuse the long posting.

        "content": "Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\n     when questioning? \n\nI've often found it to be the case that the theist\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     \"being.\"  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\n     of God's existence and question it impartially?\n     \nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n\n\n--",

On what\nra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call \"orthodox?\"\n\n     \"Orthodox\" is a compound word. It comes from 'orthos' (straight, true, \n     right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). I use orthodox to \n     refer to 'right teaching.' Right teaching is derived from letting God \n     speak to us through the Bible. This can be from reading simple truths \n     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.\n\nra> Who is that \"holds that\" Luke meant what you said he meant?\n\n     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are\n     pertinent.\n\n     Luke 23:43 records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on\n     an adjacent cross: \"Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in\n     paradise.\" But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead\n     and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until\n     Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The\n     answer lies in the location of \"paradise\" when Jesus died.\n\n     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.\n\n     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and \n     Lazarus as \"Abraham's Bosom,\" to which the godly beggar Lazarus was\n     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus\n     \"Abraham's Bosom\" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed\n     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection.\n\n     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of \n     hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith\n     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven\n     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or\n     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with\n     the Father.\n\n     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the\n     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But\n     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene\n     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then\n     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise\n     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in\n     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: \"Ascending on high, He led captivity\n     captive; He gave gifts unto men.\" Verse 9 continues: \"But what does `He\n     ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the\n     earth?\" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: \"He who descended is the same\n     as He who ascended above all the heavens.\" Presumably He led the whole\n     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of\n     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.\n\nra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is\nra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to\nra> \"look at the Bible\" in order to see the truth, but what of those who\nra> see Biblical things differently from you?\n\n     I think that this characterization is faulty.

Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can \n     have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put \n     forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to \n     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views\n     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.\n\nra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really\nra> understands it?\n\n     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is \n     wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.

It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will\ntake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice\nC.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd have\nto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they\ntake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next\n18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay\nfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen\nnot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid\nfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in\nconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly\nlegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded\nbut some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money going\nto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those\nwomen who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice\nB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see any\nreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing\npersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is\nwhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*\nis what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,\nand that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your\n\"taxes\" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being\n*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your\nobjections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,\nas I'm sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in that\narea can help out in another--like our massive debt.)\n\n\n>>If you disagree then give us some \"reasons\".

Uncle Bill doesn't pay for \n>breast augmentation, facelifts, etc...  Why abortions?  It's elective \n>surgery!  \n\nThose other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savings\nin other procedures that would be required down the road without them.\n(In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)\nThis is quite different from the case of abortion.\n\n>As for your argument, you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making \n>it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too, SO YOU \n>ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS!

Your kind of double-\n>talk really makes me ill.\n\nThis is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing \"to make the alternative affordable\ntoo\".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*\nyour statement would make sense.

Pro-Abortion really fits in your case.\n\nYes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.\n\n>If you're gonna fund one choice, you have to fund them all, at the very \n>least.\n\nYOU STUPID FUCK!  *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices.  *YOU* are the\none who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices.\n\n>        IMHO if we fund the adoption choice right, (meaning not just \n>throwing money at it but cutting costs, esp. legal costs) we won't need \n>abortion anymore.\n\nYour humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is still\nthe fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young woman\ncould need to be getting an education.

He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-\n antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and\n grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.\n\nWorship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.\n\nHundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman\n Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of\n Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship\n was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership\n in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in\n ancient times is fascinating!\n\nOh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.\n\nI am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the\n Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels\n of initiation.

What do you mean 'all in the same situation?' Let's take me\nand Dennis Kriz as examples. We're in pretty different situations,\nbut I think we can agree as to whether it's day or night.

There are people who convert from\nnon-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (I\ndon't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be an\ninteresting thing to know.)  I think that religion is a crutch.  People are\nnaturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't want\nto believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there is\nnothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.\nReligion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things\nscience has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of\nsecurity... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.\nThat they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  This\nhas a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these\npeople are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their\nbelief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind of\nuseless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy with\ntheir fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too\n(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept\nthe harsh reality that they are running from).\n\nAnyway, I'm getting kind of carried away here.  But my point is that theism\ndoesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow\nup as a theist (although this happens far too often).

        "content": "Russell Turpin, as is his wont, has raised some interesting issues \nin his struggle with the Christian texts and the Christians. \nUnfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is \nnot available. The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable \nresult of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such \nas humanity. \n\nAlso unfortunately (perhaps) I have a deadline in two weeks, the \nresponsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience, \nfrom writing a more considered response and fully entering the\nfray, as it were. \n\nLet me then say what I can, briefly.\n\n-----\n\n>The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are\n>so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  \n\nThis point, for the net.browsers who also still read books, is\npursued throughly in Kaufmann, Critique_of_Religion_and_Philosophy.\n\n>The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\n>in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\n>he has \"ultimate responsibility.\" \n\nThis is a theological statement worthy of Barth.\nDr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)\n\n>Indeed, many traditions present\n>an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\n>loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and\n>relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\n>because it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\n>responsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\n>goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \n\nThis requires the assumption that all interpretations are\nequally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing\namong them. I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is\na reasonable assumption. \n\n>And who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\n>are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\n>reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\n\nMichael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian\nglasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the\nNT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some\npoints in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly \nabrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with\nadequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew,\nand probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) )\n\nThis part is, I discover, what most moves me to post:\n\nmls> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n>No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \n>seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\n>gospel.\n\nRussell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate.\nMichael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal, \nwhich seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are \npossible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Merton\nwas a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Francis\nwas a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed?\n\nmls> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\nmls> tell you something about Christianity? ...\n\nMichael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have\ntwo hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) )\nRussell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's\ntheological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;\nDean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' More\ndirect, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?'\nThe implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the \ntradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your idea\nof the tradition doesn't include him, Change your idea of the tradition!\n\n>The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\n>se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\n>gays.  \n\nHow can one answer this while staying on the more general issue?\nI'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael)\non this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement.\n\nOne verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, from\nPaul (of all people):\n\n'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28\n{I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry \nthem in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...' \n(roughly, from Romans). [If Russell would promise to convert based\non these or any other verses,  I'd promise to get the full context\nfor any that he requires :-) :-)]\n\n>In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\n>make Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\n>be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\n>Christian interpretation.  \n\nThis conclusion does not follow, even in short, from the\nargument that goes before.

Or are the allegations just part of the Big\n> Cover-Up?\n\nThank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being\na Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a\nconviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the \"fundy\" part as the\nterm fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to\nthose who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and\nwish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it\nmatter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been\nsatisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling\nstruggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.\n\nWith respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you\nto re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume\nthat defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his\nright to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'\ntheology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-\nDavidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect\nof the tragic events of the past few days.\n\nNor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the\nfederal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting\ninfants so it must be true even though such allegations do not\nfall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are\nstate and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the\nlocal level by proper authorities with no successful charge having\never been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent\nas Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least\nthat's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-\ngandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a\nlustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might\nbring upon him.  \n\nBut evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the\nbuilding in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined\nby qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse\nand none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with\nDavidians several times before the conflagration, reported that\nthe children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.\n\nUltimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh\nis quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a\nmost wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.\nSo I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One\nwho has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left\non earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong\nmessage to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the\npeople it serves.\n\n--Joe Gaut\n\n> \n> (I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I wouldn't\n> put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.

I took me a long time to come\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN.

This is also true of most religions.\nThere is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people\nwho call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually\n*BEING* any of these.

This does not,\nhowever, preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another\nin a specific set of circumstances.

As for statements inside the\nBible, things are still not that clear, we don't have any indications\nfor instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament, one of the \nfew books that actually talks about Satan.

You have to understand\nthe mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical\nrelativist. If you don't understand the underlying concepts, it is \npretty hard to continue with a dialogue. I'm not a perfect Christian,\nhowever about 20+ years of Christian teaching should have provided\nme with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame.\n\nCheers,\nKent\n\n---\nsandvik@newton.apple.com.

It is the most\ndangerous way to arrest anyone.  The cops are charging into a room\nand they don't know what is in it.  It is much safer to surround the\nplace and announce yourself.\n\n\n>Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's\n>not an excuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD's, there was\n>almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who\n>would pretend to be cops.\n\nCops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers.\n\n\nMost drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the\nlikelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works.  If they\nare arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea\nbargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will\nbe charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drug\ndealers have guns for protection from their customers and other\ncriminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids\nbecause the criminals aren't aware that they are cops.\n\nNo-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to\nend in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not\ncommitted any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house\ncannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they have\nthe means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the\nhousebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.\n\nThe first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to\nsearch for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal\nweapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not called\nfor.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF could\nhave surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have driven\nup to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and\nserved the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koresh\nrefused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of\nthe t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.\n\n--\nRod Anderson  N0NZO         | \"I do not think the United States government\nBoulder, CO                 | is responsible for the fact that a bunch of\nrcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu      | fanatics decided to kill themselves\"\nsatellite  N0NZO on ao-16   |        Slick Willie the Compassionate",

Let's consider some \"personal interpretations\"\nand see how much trust we should put in \"Orthodox Mormonism\", which\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\n\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\nMcConkie said they \"thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\nMessiah.\" He also said Christians are wrong to believe \"that Jehovah is\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father],\" and that Christ \"came into\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\n\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\n\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\nexamining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\n\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\n\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\n\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\n\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'...\" (Articles of Faith,\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\n\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\n\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\n\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\n\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\nMcConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\n\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\n  Messianic prophecy?\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\n  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\n  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\n  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\n\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\n\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\nwhich reads:\n\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\n\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\n\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\n\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\n\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\nthe Father.\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\n  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\n  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\n  Messiah, p. 532)\n\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's \"arrest and\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\n\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\n\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\n\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\nwill be considered in this examination.\n\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\n\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in\nChrist's death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\n\n        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.\n        110:4.\n\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\n  says: \"The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\n  p. 450)\n\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\n\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\n     (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\nhim [Christ]...\"\n\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\nverses.\n\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\nthese Scriptures:\n\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\n\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\n\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\n\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\nthe Messiah.\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\n\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\n\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\n\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\n\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\n\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\n\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. \"The\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\n\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\n\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\n\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\n\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\n\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\n\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\n\n        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\nScriptures prove this fact:\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\n\n  \"...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\n  son... (Zech. 12:1,10)\n  Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,\n  and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)\n\n  \"...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.\n  43:3)\n  ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)\n\n  \"And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of\n  the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)\n  \"...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)\n\n  \"Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his\n  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)\n  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.\n  22:12)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with\n  thee. (Zech. 14:5)\n  \"...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1\n  Thess. 3:13)\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)\n  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)\n\n  \"...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...\n  (Ezek. 34:15-16)\n  ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\n  (Luke 19:10)\n\n  \"For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy\n  Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)\n  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great\n  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and\n  Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;\n  Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and\n  Rev. 3:19)\n\n        While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" they\nare wrong when they say He is not \"Elohim.\" The Bible reveals that\n\"Jehovah\" is the only true \"Elohim\" there is; all others are false.\nRemember, \"Jehovah\" is the personal name of the triune God who has\nrevealed Himself in the Bible.\n\n        Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that \"Jehovah\" and\n\"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note\nthat not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as \"Jehovah\"\nand \"Elohim\" but so is the Holy Spirit.\n\n  \"Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I\n  will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my\n  laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And\n  their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)\n  (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" and \"said\" added)\n  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a\n  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...\n  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;\n  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people....

(Jer.\n  31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy\n  men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_.

See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)\n\n        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that\n\"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.\n\n  \"And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,\n  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,\n  Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R.

See also Ps. 144:15)\n\n  \"Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God\n  [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah], the Creator of the ends of the earth,\n  fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his\n  understanding.

(Ps. 50:1)\n\n  \"Sing unto God [Elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that\n  rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. (Ps.\n  68:4) [Regarding the word \"Jah,\" Bruce R. McConkie stated: \"Jah\n  (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all\n  of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel.\" Mormon\n  Doctrine, p. 391]\n\n  \"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from\n  Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose\n  name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that\n  dwelleth between the cherubims.

(Jer. 32:18)\n\n  \"O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the\n  wind....\n  Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD\n  [Jehovah]....\n  That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most\n  high over all the earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18)\n\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah's\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\n5:27)\n\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\nBible reveals that \"Elohim's\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\n\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\n\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\n\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\nman's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\ntruth about who created man.\n\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\n  him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)\n\n  \"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for\n  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have\n  made_....\n  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on \"souls...I\n  have made\" added)\n\n  \"Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...\n  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee\n  from the womb_.\n  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...\n  I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...\n  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD\n  [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.\n  4:32,35)\n\n  \"Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the\n  earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the\n  people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)\n\n  \"...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of\n  Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon\n  the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)\n\n        The Bible reveals that it is \"Jehovah\" who is the \"Elohim of the\nspirits of all flesh\" and \"of all flesh\" itself, that it was He who\n\"formed the spirit of man within him,\" that He \"made us this soul\" and\n\"formed us from the womb.\" He did indeed \"create man.\"\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\"\nthen they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\n\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\n\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I\n  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\n  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\n  all things that in them are.\n  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\n\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\n\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\n\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\n  Abraham's writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: \"We will\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\n\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\n\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\n\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\n\n        Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\n\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\n\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\n\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\n\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\n\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\n\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\n  developed....\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\n  Father, and to him only....\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\n\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\n\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\n\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\n\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\n\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\n\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\n\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\n\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\n\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\n\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\n\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\nidolatry.\n\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)\n\n  \"Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)\n\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)\n\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].\n  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:\n  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto\n  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)\n\n  \"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\n  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)\n\n  \"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;\n  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to\n  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.\n  (Josh. 23:7)\n\n  \"...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)\n\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\n  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)\n\n  \"And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,\n  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods\n  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about\n  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]\n  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)\n\n  \"Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\n\n  \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\n  24:15-16)\n\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\nand all therein.\n\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\n\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim's\" covenant\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim's\" of\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\n\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\n\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\nworld to redeem mankind.\n\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\n\"Jehovah.\"\n\nSummary\n\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\n\n        In answer to Jesus' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\n\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\n\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\n1)\n\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\nThe Bible says:\n\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\n\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\n\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\n\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\n\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life. (John\n17:3)\n\n  \"...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you.\" (Ju. 2:3. See also\n  Exod. 23:32-33)",

When we\ndo something to make a particle \"appear,\" we are actually causing\nall the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is\none line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some\nof the scientific community.\n\nDr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused\nby the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys that\nmind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolates\nthat if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousness\nis the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).\n\nIt all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is that\nthis would explain the phenomenon of \"magick\" as practiced in my\nreligion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind\ncould be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of\npossible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of\ncommunication between ones current, and possible future selves. \nI have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self\ndelusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection\nof one of many possible futures.\n\nI realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep \nan open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile \nexplaination of the world in which we find ourselves.

If anything, one could claim that,\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\n\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\n\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\nsalvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\nmartyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.\n\nZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from\nMazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The\netymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name,\nas uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else-\nwhere. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the\nGreek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old\nIranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht,\nseveral Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht.\nWe can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra,\nmeans \"camel.\" The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used\ntraditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when\nZarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into\ncommon use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books\nof Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.]\n  Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in\nWestern culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented,\nand heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas (\"songs\"),\nattributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the\nAvesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha\nSpentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha\nVashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the\nprophet's death.\n  Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger\nAvesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the\nPahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid\ninscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is\nmentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who\nseems unaware of him).\n  The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true\nchronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect\nway, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose\nwas not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the\nother hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra,\nalthough from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him\nsix thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus,\nHermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The\naccount by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean\nsix hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes\nagainst Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes\nreference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut\nHumbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it\nis generally rejected.\n  Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are\nnonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history\nof the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as\nthe above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time\nZarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an\nextremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet\ncould not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close\nto, that of the Achaemenids.\n  Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono-\nlogy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord-\ning to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander.\nAgain, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as\nhistorically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical\njustification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the\nlatter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface\nbecause it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed\nby Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around the\nbeginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex\nproblems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the\npart of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this\ncontext, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after\nthe beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and\nVishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium\n(thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).\n  Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to\nreconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally\non the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus\nthe Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the\ngreat political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of\nthe first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that\nperiod, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same\ntime, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be\njustified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara-\nthushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the\nmost legitimate.\n  As to Zarathushtra's land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of\nvalid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that\nhe was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra\nwith Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language\nof the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose,\nboth on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east,\neven though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable\nvariety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view\nthat he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian\nregion, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however,\nZarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the\nHindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia\n(modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would\nthus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.\n  Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna\n33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a\nspecific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned\nreligious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an\nathravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly\ncaste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used\nto lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the\nproduct of a great and original ethical mind.\n  Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India\nto Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan,\nor \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks\ntruth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate -\nand blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the \"vision\nof asha,\" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the\n\"vision of the Sun,\" a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this\nlanguage lies the great tradition of \"Aryan mysticism,\" that is, of Indo-Iranian\nmysticism.\n  Zarathushtra's greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a\nparticular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength\nof his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force-\nfully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic\nmonotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the\nevil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl.,\nFrashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti] \n  Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological\ndoctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra's teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi-\ntions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic\nand ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem\nof evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward\nreligiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi-\ntion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.\n  Another original facet of Zarathushtra's message, one that is not easy to\nunderstand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the\ncomplex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the\nAmesha Spentas, the \"beneficent immortals.\" These are spiritualizations of the\nabstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous\ndevotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a\nsystem of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the\nmanifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.]\n  Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (\"possessing gray horses\"),\nand of his mother, Dughdova (\"one who has milked\"), we know almost nothing of\nZarathushtra's life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.\nAccording to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at\nthirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful\ninspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did\nhe succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was\nstrongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly\ngroups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility\ncaused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of\nKavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with\nhis wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two\nyears old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (\"desiring pastures\"),\nand of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more\nsons, Urvatatnara (\"commanding men\") and Hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of\nhis second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (\"possessing good\ncattle\") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned:\nFrashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi's father, and the latter as the\nhusband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (\"very thoughtful\"),\nwhose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again,\naccording to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was\nassassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the\nTuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi\nform).\n  The paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi-\ntion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian\ncommunities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of\nthe Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as\npassages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth\ncentury, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i\nBahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about\nZarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the\nperfect man.\n  Zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the\nRenaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic\nperiods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an \"alien\nwisdom,\" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer,\npsychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the\ninfluence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always\nopenly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and\nadvocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as\na precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the\nbiblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural\nsign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three\nMagi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is\nderived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the\nFuture. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the\nSasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the\nspread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra's popularity in the\nChristian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised\noften by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three\ngreat messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture\nand heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss-\nance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara-\nthushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was\nviewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean\nOracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a\npossible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in\nVoltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.\n  After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave\nthe name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883-\n1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the\ntrue motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between\ngood and evil. [See also Zoroastrianism]",

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\n\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\n\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\non what origins we are talking about.\n\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\n\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\n\nMore to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\nscope of discussion.\n\n4) This is a false premise.\n\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\n\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\n\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\n\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.\n\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\n\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\n\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\nwith the following contextual modification:\n\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\n\n-----\n\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\n-- \nRichard Harter: SMDS Inc.

You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C.\n    Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are\n    iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun\n    were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel\n    parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be\n    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.\n\n2.  A fire is not an isothermal process.  There are 'hot' spots and\n    'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.

Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow\nhim to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I\nsuspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.\n\nIt is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from\nall perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any\nconclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my\nperspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to\nlife; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what\nthey like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in\nfavour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise\nsolution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and\ndeciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This\nis also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own\ndecisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy\nwith current UK abortion law.\n\nSimilarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and\nI really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't even\nknow enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.\n\n\nmathew",

If a scientist creates a unique living creature\n#(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the\n#right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?\n\nDear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions,\nbut that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there\nare respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,\nme, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)\nin the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,\nan earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by\nsight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things\nto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of\nGod's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of\nthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed\nthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations (\"I\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . .\" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\n(\"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\nthem to the earth . . .\" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\n\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\nwe made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: \"Where wast thou\nwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" Job 38:4-7).  We\nlost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the \"Veil of Forgetful-\nness,\" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.\n\nYou may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the\nBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular\naspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.\n\n#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so\n#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,\n#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?\n#\n#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\n(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd\nas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe\nin the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They\nwill cry \"heresy\" and other accusations of \"perverting\" the doctrines of\nthe Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as\nfound in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)\n\nAs for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as\nexplained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea\nScroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not\nleast, modern-day revelation on the subject.\n\n#I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.\n#\n#                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that\n#                        he is acting according to God's will, and who there-\n#     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by\n#                        stabbing you in the back?\n#\n#                                                        -Voltaire\n\n\nCasper C.

        "content": "Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use\nthe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \ncommon.\n\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\n\nFor example,\n\nStory of Adam and Eve:\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\n\nTraditional Philosophy:\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This\nis why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \nquestion by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.\n\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\n\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \nthemselves.\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\n\n1990's philosophy:\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\n\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\n\nLessons from new interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\nis ideal.\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\nlife for their children (and themselves).\n\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\nEve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \nuntil it was actively sought.\n\n---End serious discussion.  Begin humor.--\n\nSave this post to disk (or file server).  Someday it will be considered the\nmost important writing since the 10 Commandments.  You want an original copy.\n\nStay tuned for the RFD on soc.religion.eveism...\nCan I get a tax deduction for money I donate to this organization?\n\n--Return to serious discussion when posting follow-ups.--\n\nStephen Weinstein\nweinss@rpi.edu",

That is, ignorance of the Bible\nand the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its \ncontents.\n\n> I regard Christ as a myth. \n\nBecause you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.\nAnd to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not\neven know what the word \"Christ\" means.

The only person who can really judge me is *me*.\n\nYes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Come\nup with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being said\nand by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else's\ninterpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you the\ntruth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as \nmuch as a coffee cup needs interpretation.\n\nAnd remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.  \nIt doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The \nBible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed \nto people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it \ntheir open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because they\nwant you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to\nknow.   They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple\nstraight-forward language.\n\n> I choose the\n> roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of\n> any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn\n> back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.\n\nYou have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen the\nroad that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that\nroad doesn't look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  One\nthat goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this,\nyou will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly. \n\n>And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your\n>eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I'm not just spouting off\n>empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.\n\nI see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading your\nlife.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing \nnew in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are \"spouting off\" \ncontradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must\nbe sad.\n\n> I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?

For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son\nso that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I look\nwhat God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have \nhope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has\nglorious purpose.\n\n> You can't even convince me that it exists! \n\nBecause you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose to\nlie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for \nthousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of \nJesus's story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a \nbleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:\n\n      \"For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets,\n       he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead.\"\n\n> If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold\n> pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my\n> rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can\n> *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful\n> it is.\n\nArrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specific\ncases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect\nin heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus does\nnot expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not\nas his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his\nglorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.  \nYou maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself for\nyourself.\n\n>>Why would you want to live a good life?\n>>To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.

But that's is not what I feel went amiss here.\n\nYou missed the point.  Living a \"good life\" has no eternal consequences.\nOnce they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it \nis over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. \nIt has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. \n\nBut then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things \nis bad.  To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is\nall meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone\nyou dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What's restraining you?\nLife after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.\n\n> In the same way, I think life is fun.  And I don't intend to leave the\n> amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D\n\nAt which time, you are truly not the master of yourself.\n\n>>I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god\n>>I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in\n>>which case it's not really all that important.\n>\n>Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.\n\nSo you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa\nClaus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to\nbelieve that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I\ncan't similarly apply to Santa Claus.\n\nYou have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses\nof Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and \"ignore\" the\nreasons.  By definition, \"ignorance\". \n\nSanta Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves\nand flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in human\nhistory seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose \nblinks red?    \n\nOn the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar really\na king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomon\nreally kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin?\nDid Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  Did\nSennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a \nCaiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies\nit.  It is NONFICTION.\n\nDo you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps you\ncan't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from\nthat of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equal\ntruthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Or\nis it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out\nthat it's not a fairy tale?\n\n>Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a\n>collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without\n>invoking them?\n\nGet real.  Have you ever been to Zaire?  Do you have to go there\nto be  assured that there really is such a place?  Given your \nirrationality, I take it you have never used a map in your life.\n\n> Why do you believe what you believe?\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living\nGod, I'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if I didn't follow Jesus.",

Most \n          victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past, usually \n          during a PREVIOUS LIFE. \n          \n               What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of \n          EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators, in \n          a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence), \n          that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM, in this \n          life or the next. \n          \n               Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION, and the \n          related \"LAW of Retribution\", should read books such as \"HERE \n          AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, which describes several \n          kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation, including \n          HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [about 50% accurate; the \n          subconscious mind can sometimes make things up, especially \n          with a bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by \n          young children, some of whom can identify their most recent \n          previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL \n          of past life experiences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off \n          land while traveling there for the first time on vacation), \n          the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN \n          SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including \n          Matthew 17:11-13 (John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of \n          Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How can a person POSSIBLY sin before \n          he is born, unless he LIVED BEFORE?!). \n          \n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \n          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, \n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \n          another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT \n          life, because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \n          INCARNATION. \n\n               People would behave much better toward each other if \n          they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be \n          reaped by them in the future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \n\n \n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (books like \"HERE AND \n          HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery). \n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \n\n\n                                   Robert E.

        "content": ": In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\n: reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. \n\nI'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is\ninterpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on\nthe values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\nactivity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or\nethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure\nfrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.\n\nBill\n\n: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\n: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\n: the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\n\n: So, back to the original question:\n\n: And objective morality is.....?\n\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\nobjective sense.\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\ninfinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself\ndoesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as\n\nBill\nmuch to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it\nor not, it's there.x",

Postings to such groups as soc.history and\n>soc.culture.german has not uncovered any net.experts who could provide\n>any. \n\nWell, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before \"the night of the\nlong knives\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\nescapes me at the moment) called \"Homosexuals in History\" asserts that Roehm\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.\n\n>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,\n>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and\n>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. \n\nWell, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \"knight of the\nlong knives\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've \nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \n\n>(Irving, a\n>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance\n>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)\n\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they \nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \n\n>I challenge anyone to document this claim.\n\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\n\n>I *have* found a great\n>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the\n>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,\n>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.\n\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\n\nI don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.\n\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\n\nNo, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\n                                                                           \n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\nDavid Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)\n\"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softly\nof us in days hereafter...\" (Ezra Pound)\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/",

        "content": "Brian Ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of False Dichotomy in stating\nthat we must accept every thing in the books attributed to Peter, or we must\ndiscount every other book of antiquity:\n\n>>(1) Peter died two millenia ago.  The original letters he wrote have\n>>long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could\n> \n> Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\n> Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?   Their documents\n> have decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse? \n\nMr Ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything\nwritten in every \"historical\" document.  Somehow I doubt do that yourself\nthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical\ndocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith\nin the words of the books attributed to Peter. \n\nI shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you\nreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by\nMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were\ncarved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather\nthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \n\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\nII.\n\n\tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\n\ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\n\tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\n\tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\n\tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\n\tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\n\tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\n\tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\n\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses \"divine word,\" but also that\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \nbattle.)\n\n\tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\n\tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\n\twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\n\tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\n\n\tNo officer was with me, no charioteer,\n\tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\n\tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\n\tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them.\n\tHis majesty spoke: \"What is this, father Amun?\n\tIs it right for a father to ignore his son?\n\tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\n\tDo I not walk and stand at your word?\n\tI have not neglected an order you gave.\n\tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\n\tTo allow aliens to step on his path!\n\tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\n\tThe wretches ignorant of god?\n\tHave I not made for you many great monuments,\n\t...\n\tI call to you, my father Amun,\n\tI am among a host of strangers;\n\tAll countries are arrayed against me,\n\tI am alone, there's none with me!\n\t...\n\tThe labors of many people are nothing,\n\tAmun is more helpful than they;\n\tI came here by the command of your mouth,\n\tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!\"\n\n\tNow though I prayed in a distant land,\n\tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\n\tI found Amun came when I called to him,\n\tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\n\tHe called from behind as if near by:\n\t\"Forward, I am with you,\n\tI your father, my hand is with you,\n\tI prevail over a hundred thousand men,\n\tI am lord of victory, lover of valor!\"\n\tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\n\tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\n\t...\n\tI slaughtered among them at my will,\n\tNot one looked behind him,\n\tNot one turned around,\n\tWhoever fell down did not rise.\n\t...\n\tOne called out to the other saying:\n\t\"No man is he who is among us,\n\tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\n\tNot deeds of man are these his doings,\n\tThey are of one who is unique,\n\tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\n\tCome quick, flee before him,\n\tTo seek life and breathe air;\n\tFor he who attempts to get close to him,\n\tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp.\n\tOne cannot hold either bow or spears,\n\tWhen one sees him come racing along!\"\n\tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin,\n\tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.\n\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being\n*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\nwords: \n\n    \"question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?\"\n\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\n\"all or nothing\" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\ncompletely credible. \n\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\nmust be true:\n\n> Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \n> Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\n> shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\n> programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\n> complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\n> that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\n> display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\n> King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln?\n \nI have three points.  \n\nFirst, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\nthe testimony of Hindus:\n\n\t\"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \n\t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \n\t hooey?\"\n\nIf you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special\npleading?\n\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \n\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was\nmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a\ndeist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've\npreviously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc. \n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    \"My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of \n     salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become \n     clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for \n     thinking I shall ever change them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tAbraham Lincoln\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Judge J S Wakefield \n\t\t\t\t\tafter the death of Willie Lincoln.",

Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, \"THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help \"prove\" Einstein's \"General Theory of Relativity\". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \n          holes\", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to \"prove\" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \"NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by\nI think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that\nBenjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings\non Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how\nmuch he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and \nAristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus\nmakes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology,\nthe id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus\nexplained it far better and gave reasons.\n\nThomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They\ncan screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these\nmen on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly,\nhe thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.\n\nHere's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians\nthat \"that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is \nspiritually discerned.\"  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a\nclue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that's\nincredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally\nbizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance on\nmy part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless,\nit is a truth, explainable or not.\n\nAre any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those\ndot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in front\nof you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If\nyour eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals\nembedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand\nout from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green,\nyou will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot\ntest appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.\n\nA normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a\ntotal anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something.\nIt is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything\nthat to him is as plain as day.\n\nThat it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer.\nThe believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns\nfit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the\nother hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinks\nI am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and\nsay, \"No, you are weird.  You do not see.\"   Then it is time for a sanity\ncheck.  I go to another Christian and say, \"Do you see this.\"  And\nthey go, \"Yes.  It is an \"X\"\".  And I say, \"Thank God, I see the \"X\"\ntoo.\"\n\nIt is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to\nthe phrase, \n\n         \"He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.\"\n\n\nI am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see.

I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\nseems to argue over what.\n\n>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the \"who and \n>why\" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or \n>agnostics.\n\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \nthink the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \nincapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \n\n>Do you suggest that the \"who and why\" will forever be closed to scientific \n>investigation?\n\nNo.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \nIsn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \nconvoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  \n\n>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on\n>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.\n\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \nand not, for the most part, who and why.

        "subject": "Hell",
        "content": "In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words \ntranslated into the word \"hell\".  These Greek words have totally different \nmeanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.\n\n    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the \nNew Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol...\nmeaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be \nlikened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)\n\n    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell\nto translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  \n\n    Why?  Because when seeing the word \"hell\" many readers impute to it the \ntraditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never \nremotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!\n\n    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of \nthe dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of \n\"shadowy realm.\"  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to \nthis hell.\n\n    The second \"hell\" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in \nscripture, 2 Pet.2:4; \"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \nthem down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be \nreserved unto judgment...\"\n\n    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; \nRev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels \n(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to \nTartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the \nmutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).\n\n    Tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or\ndemons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe \nthe place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible \nis there any mention of men being put into this particular \"hell\".\n\n    The the third word that is translated as \"hell\" in the Bible is Gehenna. It\ncomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning \"valley of Hinniom.\"  Hinnom is a \ndeep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.\n\n    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including \ninfant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made \ntheir children \"pass through the fire\" to the god Molech.  The rites were \nspecifically celebrated in Tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief \ngroves in the valley).\n\n    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He \ndefiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later \nthe valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for \nsewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were \nalso burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding \nby a constant supply of garbage and refuse.\n\n    Aceldama, the \"field of blood\", purchased with the money Judas received for\nthe betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.\n\n    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?  \n\n    In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working \nreligious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the \nre-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.\nTheir fate is revealed by the apostle John: \"And the beast was taken, and with \nhim the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire \nburning with brimstone.\"\n    \n    Where will this temporary lake of fire (this \"hell\") be?\n\n    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: \"For \nTophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is \nprepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, \nthe breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it\" (Isa.30:33).\n\n    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled \nfiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).\n\n    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible \nsay that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of \nfire?\n\n    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be \nthrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will \nbecome of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity? \n \n    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna \nfire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This \npunishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the \n\"second death\" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a \nfurther resurrection.\n\n    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.\n                           \n    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. \"For, behold, the day \ncometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do \nwickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up...\"\n(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be \"ashes under the \nsoles of your feet...\"(Mal.4:3).\n\n    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living \ntorture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or \nvalley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, \nbut ashes!\n \n    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means \ncomplete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The \nBible says, in Romans 6:23, \"The wages of sin is death\", not eternal life in \ntorture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of \nlife. \n    \n    Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD!",

It's similar to collecting coins,\nor stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model\ntrains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about\neverything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it something\nof an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really;\nit's just a hobby.

Surely You will revive us again, so that\nYour people may rejoice in You. Show us, O LORD, Your faithfulness;\ngrant us Your deliverance. Let me hear what God, the LORD, will speak;\nHe will promise well-being to His people, His faithful ones; may they\nnot turn to folly. His help is very near those who fear Him, to make His\nglory dwell in our land. Faithfulness and truth meet; justice and\nwell-being kiss. Truth springs up from the earth; justice looks down\nfrom heaven. The LORD also bestows His bounty; our land yields its\nproduce. Justice goes before Him as He sets out on His way.",

        "content": "ZOROASTRIANISM\nSAN JOSE, CA, USA\nMonday April 5, 1993\nSan Jose Mercury News, Page 1\n     [Reproduced without permission]\n\n_3,700-year tradition still glows - \n           'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_\n\nBy Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer\n\n   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a\ngleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States -\ndedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.\n\n   With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that\ntheir faith will survive this land.\n\n   \"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.\n\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\"\n\n   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.\nBut for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.\n\n   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep\nit scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \"historical sites\" are\nsometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\nZoroastrian prophet.\n\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\npeople is very much on their minds.\n\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\n\n   \"It's important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It's important\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\nYou don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\n\n   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.\n\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\n\n_Good vs. evil_\n\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\n\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\n\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\n\n   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\n\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\nwhere others had no rights.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\nthis continent.\n\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\ncommunity center.\n\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\n\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\n\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\nZoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\n\n  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people\ncame to worship and revel.\n\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\nproved him right.\n\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\nand nuts.\n\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\n\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\n\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.

Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\npeople's religion.\n\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\n\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\n\n   \"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the\ndifference with the lower animals?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------ end of article ----",

This assured that\nIsaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important\nspiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.\n\nSo you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the\nJewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture,\nyour gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead\npeople to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn't stop us from\nrespecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize\nyou and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to\n  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive\n  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS \n  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)\n\nSince it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin\nof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \"no good\"\nbecause it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not \nthe authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time \nbefore I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, \nProfessor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the \nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring \n1993 edition):\n\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\n  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn't draw\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\n  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\n  that the central pillar of Christ's \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\n\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\n\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\n\n\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\nto This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\narms.  \n\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \nvoice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand\non in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter \nthe LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths \nand non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to \ndisprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. \nLet us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion \nand conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.  \n\n \nHal Leifson -- signing off!",

Man knows in his heart that there is right and wrong.  We have\n>all inherited this knowledge.  \n\nNo matter how \"absurd\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by\nmankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common\nmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\n\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\n\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\nwritten down by man.\n\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\nhave done).\n\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\nthink the important aspect is the result.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:\n\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\nAs they swam its clearness through.",

Good and\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\n\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\nthe Scriptures.\n\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\n\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\n\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\n\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\n\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\n\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\n\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it\nwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the\nanswer to his dilemma in vs 25.\n\n                                 Mark",

It is my habit to check my articles before and\nafter their submission for errors.  In my last article I stated:\n \n> (By the way Mr DeCenso, you really should have looked in the index of your\n> Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich Greek lexicon.

I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus\nconfused \"kleros\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of\nland discussed.  In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\n1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\ncannot report as to the nuances of the word.\n \nI don't know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure that\nsomeone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating\nmistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point\"\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nMY REPLY...\nVary noble of you Dave.  I didn't want to have to go to x number of sources to\nshow you wrong.  (Although I am researching CHORION a little).\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only other reference Mr DeCenso has given is Bullinger.  And\nBullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when I accused Mr DeCenso of\nactually believing Bullinger, he replied that I misquoted him:\n \n>> \"And you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing?  Oh dear.\"\n>\n> My Reply...\n> Your misquotes of me are astounding, Dave.

I did not realize\n  that you would find such garbage beneficial, unless you were convinced by\n  it].\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThank you for correcting your restating of my points.\n \nDB...\n\"and Mr DeCenso also replied:\n \n> Dave, these are not necessarily my views; they are Bullinger's.

I'm only responding to\n>this one you have directed re: Bullinger's views because it's enjoyable.\n \nThus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such \"drek\"\nconvincing....he should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincing\nand quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of \"This is what Bullinger\nbelieved, not necessarily what I believe.\" So which is it Mr DeCenso? Do you\nfind the exegisis convincing or not?)\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nOne of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and\nothers is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations\nraised by various Bible scholars and students alike.  When I present MY VIEWS,\nI will clearly distinguish them from now on.\n \nDB...\n\"Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented\nno Greek exegisis at all, and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not\nreferring back to the actual Greek.  Thus we find this demand on his part for\nquality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nGood point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you\nhave produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug\ndeeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on\nthese passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.\n \nDB...\n\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as\nevidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it\noften enough:\n \n> (a) the text itself\n> (b) parallel passages\n> (c) other pertinent Scriptures\n> (d) historical context\n> (e) historical content\n> (f) other pertinent historical info\n> (g) cultural context\n> (h) cultural content\n> (i) other pertinent cultural info\n> (j) grammatical construction\n> (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies\n> (l) etc.\n \nBut are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's\nsee, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other\npassages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has\npresented no use of:\n \n(d) historical context                or\n(e) historical content                or\n(f) other pertinent historical info   or\n(g) cultural context                  or\n(h) cultural content                  or\n(i) other pertinent cultural info     or\n(j) grammatical construction          or even\n(k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]\n \nThus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQuestion:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting\nto use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present\nshallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).\nAt this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a\ntotal exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating\naround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe\nit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:\nJudas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use\nseveral of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.\nIt will greatly enhance our study of these passages.\n \nDB...\n\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other\npassage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is\nred herring and his only real criteria seems to be:\n \n> (a) the text itself\n> (b) parallel passages\n \nMY REPLY...\nThe reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the\nPASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one\nanother.\n(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;\n(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look\nat your defense of this later.\n \nAlso, the \"reward of iniquity\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of\nsilver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at\nstating why you believe it is).\n \nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\nas he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\npassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's\nexplanation of Judas' death...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\n=============================================================\n \nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\nall.\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\ntrue and supplementary.\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\nthe same time.\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\ncase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\ninerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\nHere's what you said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\n> Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks\n> on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we\n>                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\n> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> was the decomposition of his body before his fall.\n \n\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so\nopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to\nfind Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\nJoslin's.\"\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHere, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for\nthe passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say\nit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it\ndidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\n \nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\nin this respect.\n \nDB...\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\n \n> (1) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas'\n>     death.  I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas\n>     died in the hanging.\n> (2) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down\n>     in the temple and the chief priests used, is the \"reward of iniquity\"\n>     in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with;\n>     therefore there is a contradiction.  Prove that the 30 pieces of silver\n>     and the \"reward of iniquity\" are one and the same.\n \nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\nis on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a\nlocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\n \nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\n \n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\nResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\nterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\n \nDB...\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention\nbelow.\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But\nhe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\ndiscover.\n \nDB...\n\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThank you, Dave.\n \nDB...\n\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nSo it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's\nposition.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?\n \nAlso, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or\ndeceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done\nwith Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including\ntheir \"interpretation\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find\nsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.\n \nYou also noted they \"interpreted\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although\nthat is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,\nthat's the first criteria we must examine.\n \nDB...\n\"This included:\n \n    \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\" by Woodward and Zuck\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nWhich I own.  It's a good source of commentary info.  But not inerrant.\n \nDB...\n    \"The Interpreters on Volume Commentary on the Bible\" by Laydon\n    \"The one volume Bible Commentary\" by J R Dunelow\n    \"Word meanings of the Testament\" Ralph Earl\n    \"The Abingdon Bible Commentary\" published by Abingdon\n    \"Harpers Bible Commentary\" by William Neal\n     (Actually I could have presented many more as well)\n \nMY REPLY...\nI appreciate your doing this research, Dave.  Maybe we are getting somewhere\nin how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depth\nstudy.\n \nDB...\n\"In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation\nof Matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus I can only conclude that the\n                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nGreek word \"apagchw\"(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nNo you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly\nprobable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.\n \nThe Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New\nTestament.\n \nIn the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\nit's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was\nnot followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his\ncity. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he\nwas buried in his father's tomb.\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nNotice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\nAPAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\nresult.\nIn Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\n \nAlso, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply\nmeans \"hang oneself\".\n \nDB...\n\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable\n                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^\nChristian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^above, mine]\n\"Reputable\"?  You mean ones that have never erred?\nAs far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,\neven by me. ^^^^^^^^^\n \nAs I said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nAlthough I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable\nexplanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),\nI've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.\n \nMAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,\nand went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and\nsaid, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the\nprice of blood.\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's\nfield, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of\nBlood to this day.\n \nFirst of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of\nhanging. All it says is that he \"went and hanged himself.\" Luke however, in\nActs, tells us that \"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all\nhis entrails gushed out.\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the\nother details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,\netc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead.

Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n______________________________________________________________________\n \nI quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but\nin looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,\nhighly probable.                            ^^^^^^\n \nDB...\n\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had\ndifferent ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One\nsimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as\nthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\"\nsuggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly\nexploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope\nbroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain\nhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person\nwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may\nhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell\nupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a\nsuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not\ngiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted\npost gave us some...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open.\n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nDB...\nNow truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the\nsource of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is\ncorrect: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist\nwho claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to\nthereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the\nprophesy of the Potter's field came from).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nPlease, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\nthis with you.\n \nDB...\nAs to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\nmoney with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\nthan some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\nmention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\nwhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\nJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\nthat when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\ndiscusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!\n \nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\nACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\nto those who arrested Jesus;\nACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be\ndesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'\n \nNotice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\nthat Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\nBut the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\nobtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\n         ^^^^^^\nJOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a\nthief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\nJOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had\nsaid to him, \"Buy those things we need for the feast,\" or that he should give\nsomething to the poor.\n \nSo, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.\nRight after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,\naccording to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \"wages of\niniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen\nby Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical\nexplanation of what the \"wages of iniquity\" are.  What do you think, Dave?\n \nDB...\n\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you\ncould unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking\nme what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI will gladly admit that I am a Complete Inerrantist, although I do not have\nthat big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view.\n\nFrank\n-- \n\"If one wished to contend with Him, he could not answer Him one time out\n of a thousand.\"  JOB 9:3",

In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\n> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\n\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\nindeed \"chorion.\" \n\nNow I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\n\n\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \n\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\n\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \nthink it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \"contradictions\" to \nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\nto support Mr Archer's contentions). \n\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\nBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\nadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\nwhich drives the point home). \n\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\ndiscussing the \"Potter's Field.\"\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\n\t\t\t\tHenry Ward Beecher\n\t\t\t\tAmerican Clergyman\n\t\t\t\tas recorded by George Seldes",

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\nreferences though, \"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\nfurther context).  \n\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging.\" He then\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\ndenoted as the result). \n\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\n\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\n> it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \n> died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> ^^^^ \n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\n> result.\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\n\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \n\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\nhistorical source to justify it. \n\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:\n\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\n\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \n\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\nas the 30 silvers:\n\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\n> than some other source.

Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\nthe money box, but rather said:\n\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\n     it was night.\"\n\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \n\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\nthat night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \n\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\n\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\n\n> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\n> this with you.\n\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now.

Scum has no guilt or freedom to\nchoose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen.\nHe made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.  The same goes\nfor Dr. Gunn.\n\n: But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that\n: these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any \n: assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them,\n: raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever\n: to help these children after birth?\n: \n\nHere's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs\nof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see\nstraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious\nmoral decisions based on reality.\n\nIf a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not\nconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has\nfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned\naway from his responsibility to his wife and child.\n\nHowever, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,\nshe is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\n\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \"My\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\"\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\nIt's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\ndemons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and\nwe'll ruin it the first chance we get.\n\n: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real\n: good guess.\n: \n\nAnd, it's probably right.\n\n: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.\n: \n\nIt is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our\nresponsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media\nbacks us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only\n\"responsibility\" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just\nenough to make us \"feel responsible\" without showing anything that\nmight show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to \"feel\" like\ngood people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give\nme the freedom to say \"I'm good\", and the rest of the world can burn.\nRape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where\npoor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister\nif I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,\nbecause it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church\nbecause church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.\nBut, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love\nmyself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that\na man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too \"christian\".\n\nAt the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\n\nWe've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible\nto our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or\nto our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every\ncorruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and\nof every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will\nhave to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the\nbiggest blessing this world can hope to see.\n\nWhy do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n\t We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n\t We must reach the root of the evil...\n\t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n\t from the dreadful deed...\n\t No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n\t\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n\t\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n\t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n\t\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\"\n\n\t\t- Susan B.

This is exactly what it has become -- a far cry from\n>its original position of stature .\n\nLooking at [1] we find that during Roman times \"Tyre vied with Sidon\nfor first place in the intellectual life of the period\"; that Tyre was\nthe seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;\nthat \"the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia\" was the\nbasilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its\nexports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,\nalong with other seaports, \"provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian\nand even Chinese trade\"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing\npopulation by \"following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line\nof growth\" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre\nestablished colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a \"small\nfishing village\" by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nCenturies later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \"opulent and flourishing\nbazaars\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was\n\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\"\nDuring the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held\nby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)\n\nIn [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \"other\n*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and\nZahlah.\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of\nthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)\non the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's\nwithdrawel in 1984, \"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\neconomy.\"\n\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a \"major city\")?  Why\ndoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities\nin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the\nlist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?\n\n[1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to\nthe present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.  \n\n[2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a\ncountry study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.\n\n>>In the early 1980's Tyre had over 22,000 people.\n>\n>So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\n>Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards\n>we are talking about a one-horse town.\n\nA one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.\n(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They\nmay even use cars these days. :-) \n\nThe 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says \"Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.\"  \nMost other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.\n(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same\nsource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,\nso I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for\nthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the\npopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In\nparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   \n\n>> After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200's, I believe.  What\n>>other times did it fall that you were thinking of? \n>\n>To Egypt (250 bce); to the Seleucids (198 bce); Rome (63 bce); after\n>Rome it fell to various Arab contingents until 1124 ce when it was\n>captured in the Crusades;  it was then recaptured again by the Muslims\n>in 1291 ce and subsequently pillaged; then the French, Turks, British,\n>and today, Lebanon.\n\nI thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.\nDon't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to \nthe other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make\na case for Tyre having been singled out?\n\n>>Well, it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye\n>>\"Tyrian purple\" in Roman times. \n>\n>This is correct, but they were under Roman domination, and the \n>majority of the created wealth was siphoned off.

From [2]:\nTyre \"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes\nand from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a\nlarge series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\"\n\nThe descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit\nyour characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems\nto have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching\nwhen you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small\nfishing village.\n\n>Who is Josh McDowell.\n\nA Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.\nHe happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,\n_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).\nThe same sentence, in fact.

Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\nhomosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.\n\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\n\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN \"EX-GAY\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\n\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\n\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\nthrough prayer.  \"I'd like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I'm\nno longer deserve it.\"\n  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There's no reality\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\nsexuality are men.\"\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\n  \"It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it's really impossible to\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is\nabout, I don't want to be this way anymore.\"\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\nfor hell.\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\nwhere the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\nadding, \"They'll do anything to reach these people.\"\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\n  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\nRaphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\nthat I should be a 'reformed' gay person.\"\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally's\nshow,\" \"I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\n  \"I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We'd go to conferences in other cities,\nand we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\nelse.\"\n  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\n  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\nchurch and closed the ministry's doors.  \"I'd convinced myself that there\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I'm interest-\ned in belief systems that aren't judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\nmay have brought to our community.\"\n\n---end article---\n\nCaligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\nof former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\nthem, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\nMaury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\nself-acceptance.\n\nThank you.",

The\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\n\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\n\nSome personal thoughts:\n\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\nToday's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\n\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t\na clue what is in their heart.\n\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \"first-hand\" real life and\nloving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no\nless abundant.\n\nThank you.\nPAX",

I have no particular plan (except to do\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\n\nI've had some more thoughts on my definitions:\n\nI've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\nfrequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the\nspectrum over time.\n\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\ntime which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\nFreud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\nurges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\".

I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\nfall, though.\n\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\n\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\n\n>\n>The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created\n>in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever\n>moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we\n>are supposed to live by Christ's example, you would be hard pressed to\n>argue that God is a \"do what I say, not what I do\" kind of guy.\n\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created\nin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\n\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\n\n>\n>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no\n>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.\n\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:\n\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\nAs they swam its clearness through.",

You like those conclusions?\n>I don't.\n\nI think that you are changing the meaning of \"values\" here. Perhaps\nit is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.\n\nvalue n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods\nor service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in \nusefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality\nconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as\nof a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. \nThe relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or\nlightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech\nsound. \n\nIn context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms\nof scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that\nthese definitions do not mean the same thing.\n\nIn my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\nreach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the\nword \"value\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard\nof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one\nconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on\nsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a\nscientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as\n\"objective values.\"\n\nBack to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.\nJust because the word \"values\" is used in both contexts does not mean\nthat there is a relationship between the two contexts.\n\nIf one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\nfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\nthe meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\n\nSo, back to the original question:\n\nAnd objective morality is.....?\n\nIf you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will\nbe a good beginning.\n\n>-- \n>Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'\n>odwyer@sse.ie                                  from \"Hens\",  by Evelyn Conlon\n\neric",

The issue of \"official doctrine\"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\nas \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

An awful lot of the\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\nabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\n\nAnd besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.\n\n\nmathew",

The bottom line is\n# truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.\n\nIt may be \"irrelevant\" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say\n\"bias\"?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You're right, \"the\nbottom line IS truth,\" independant from you or anyone else.  Since you\nproclaim \"truths\" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what\nauthority you do this?  Because \"it says so in the Bible?\"  --Does the\nBible \"say so,\" or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a\nscripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or \"disapproval\"?\n\nExcuse moi, but your line of \"truths\" haven't moved me one bit to persuade\nme that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the \"preachers\" of \"truth\" on\nthis net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking\ncrew, with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint...\nBTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus\nto the pharisees: \"ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,\nbut your hearts are far removed from me...\"\n\n# Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created\n# and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \"granted the Mormon\n# belief...\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to\n# have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address\n# and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the\n# conclusion that you grant.\n\nSophistry.  Look who's talking: \"jumping to conclusions?\"  You wouldn't do\nthat yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless\nwhether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points\nof view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration\nwhatsoever.\n\n#\n# The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus\n# is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS\n# belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.\n\nA beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation\nof lds doctrine.  The former KGB would have loved to employ you.\nJesus and lucifer are not \"the same,\" silly, and you know it.\n\n(...)\n\n# The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is\n# nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible\n# says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\n\nCorrection: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible\nindeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they\n\"belong to\" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have\nrebelled against God, and are not \"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\"\nbut it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to\nseparate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of\nsalvation.\n\n#\n#        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the\n#        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \"one\";\n#        (Matthew 13:38)\n\nSo?  --This illustrates nicely what I just said: the children of the\nkingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus\n(and have shown \"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the\nwicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issue\nof satan's spirit-origin (and of those who followed him) has not been\naddressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us\nabout \"the only true God,\" whom you interpret according to your own likes\nand dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about\nHim myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other\nfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different\nway or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission\nand progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob\nor opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited\nevery continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.\n\n#  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but\n#  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read\n#  something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches.\n\nSigh.  \"What the Bible teaches\"?  Or: \"what the bible teaches according to\nRobert Weiss and co.?\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\n\n(...)\n\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n#  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n#  issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n#  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may\n#  certainly be.\n\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\nas \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have\nallowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...\n\n=============================\nRobert Weiss\npsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu\n\n\nCasper C.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)",

[Would I kid you?]\n\n\nDoes one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands\nof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the\nOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\ntheir original expression.\n\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\nfrom Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \nfor many years.\n\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\n\n\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\n\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \nKellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\nin Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of\nthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\nsecret of sexual magic.\n \n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\nLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\n\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\n\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\n\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'\n\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\n\n\n\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\nfor very many interpretations.\n\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\nsupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.\n\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \nWill I?  \nI think not.\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\n\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\nI do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\nthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\n\n\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\nof the organization as it stands.\n\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \nI followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\nMass well enough for my tastes.\n \n\nThis doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\nlimited contact with other members.\n\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\nand the preservation of individual vision.\n\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\nto other posts in this thread.\n\n\nInvoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.\n\nI am I!\n\nFrater (I) Nigris (DCLXVI) CCCXXXIII",

Specifically, are you saying it's these religious \nJews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy, \nrather than by faith, who won't agree?  Orthodox Jews?  \n\nAs to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains \nunproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often \nlook to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.\nFor agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so \nsure the atheists can be counted out. \n\nFor the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,\nor David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to which\none adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it\ndepends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might \nunderstand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.\n\n   |\n-- J --\n   |\n   | stephen",

By biblical scholar I mean\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\n\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\n\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\nhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\nbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\nfaith off as fact.\n\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? \nShouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \nan evolutionary ancestry).\n\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \n\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\nresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \ncontain the first four.  \n\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\n\nIts faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. \nWhatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others. \n\nRegards,\n\nRich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota",

He is the Prophet who is revealed\nthe last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)\nthrough the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from \nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\n\n\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\n\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\n\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\n\tall things.\n\n---------------------\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\nAllah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\n\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\n\n----------------------\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\n\nA   D R O P L E T\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'an\n\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\n\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \t\t NINETEENTH LETTER  \n\n\t\t MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \n\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\n\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\ndecree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\nOur'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\neffect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\nwhile being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has\nappointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes'\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\nand more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'\n   In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger\nclaimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\nmerely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!'\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\nways.\n   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.",

The fact is, there are *two* references to\nJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least\nbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that\nJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage\nsays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the\nJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho\nfor Jesus and may be authentic.\n   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference\nto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which\nlack the references.\n\nIt is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but\nI don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in\nthe scholarly community that this is the case.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920's.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know \nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, \"Storm Troopers\" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from \ntheir footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered \"shrewd guesses\"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail.

In other\n>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday\n>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.\n\nI think the passage you're looking for is the following.\n\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \nheaven. \nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \n\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\nimpose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\nin Acts 15.)\n\nHowever there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\nissue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\nassures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we\nlive in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.\n\nIt's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\nvalues.",

Gay people are and will\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their 'cause' and\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\n\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\nin the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I've\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\n\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\n\nI'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\noppressive legisation against gays.\n\nPerhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\n\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\nwill 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\npeople's expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\n\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\nsomething very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\non thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\nGay people are not criminals.\n\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\n\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\nColorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\n\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\nembracing.\n\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\ntowards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\nexcluding people.\n\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,\nespecially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\nitself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\nto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\n\nWhatever\n\nRich :-(",

He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It\nisn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for\na persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your\nquestion.\n\nJesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\nwe would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\nand my faith would be vanity.\n\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\nsays why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \"The\nworld hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation\nof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\nneed a Saviour.\n\nAnd why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  \"The\nworld cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows\nhim.\"  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge\nthat comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is\nvery convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.\nI pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of\nknowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thank\nGod that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I'd also be\nbumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very\nPerson who created me and who loves me.",

From\nthis fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with\nCatholic doctrine.\n\nIs there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love\nstory between people of that faith, but a love story that is not\nexploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays\nproper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic\nenough to have a place on a.s.s.\n\nI would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also\nmost of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.\n\nI would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and\nincrease the erotica.

Christian people have caused\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:\n\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \n\n\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\n\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\n\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\n\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\nof the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\nperson's life creates a new situation to which morality must be\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's\n\"objective\" morality for us. \n\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \n\n\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\n\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\n\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\n\t'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall\n\tbe liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is\n\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\n\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\nseeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\nwas/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\nmorality.\" \n\nJohn Nunnally",

S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \"Love is the unfamiliar Name\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\"\n\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\n\n>As a non-believer, I find Michael's Christianity kinder and gentler.\n\nblechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \"sin\" on\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\n\n>If I take him at\n>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were\n>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If\n\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\n\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\nprohibitions.\n\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\n\n\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\n\t    in the Inquisition.\n\n\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\n\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\n\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\n\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\n\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\n\n\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\n\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\n\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\n\n\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\n\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\n\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\nof charges brought against them.)\n\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don't think that\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\nthe gospel, as if one's theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\nJesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\n\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow\n>man?) And what is the \"right thing\"?  And how does one go about\n>loving god? \n\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\nthey *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\"\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\n\n>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo\n>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the\n>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.\n\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\nIt does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\n\n\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\n\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\n\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll\n\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\n\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\n\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\nsystem.\n\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\n\n>I am glad that a few Christians,\n>such as Michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then\n>interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive\n>fashion.

Literally. There is\n     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible\n     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\n\n          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the \n          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];\n          (Matthew 13:38)\n\n          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which \n          ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)\n\n          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not \n          born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said \n          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I \n          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he \n          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye \n          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the \n          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the \n          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in \n          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\n\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)\n\n          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this \n          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit \n          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)\n\n          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the \n          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he \n          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)\n\n     One becomes a child of God...\n\n          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\n          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)\n\n          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that\n          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us\n          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,\n          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when\n          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he\n          is. (1 John 3:1-2)\n\n     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:\n\n          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of\n          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)\n\n          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus\n          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,\n          (Ephesians 1:5)\n\n          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should\n          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)\n\n          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of\n          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;\n          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,\n          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we\n          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)\n\n          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one\n          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)\n\n          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and\n          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is\n          begotten of him.

When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is\n     that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late\n     apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the\n     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \"I\n     have my own conclusions\" to addressing the point.\n\n     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n     issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n     subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may \n     certainly be.\n\n\n=============================\nRobert Weiss\npsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu",

O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\nestablished in the self.\n  \n                                PURPORT\n\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\nbeginning of transcendental life.\n\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\n\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\nBooks of A.C.

I've criticized bad arguments both when they\nwere yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not\ninerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the\nconclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,\nand for trying to \"explain me away\" without addressing the objections\nI raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank\nby accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.)

For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,\nthat His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes \nthrough immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex \ncanon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, \nor is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free\nto interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed\nmediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-\nstands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility \nfor understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that \nGod in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source \nfor that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink. \n \n>>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no\n>>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.\n \n>No. There may be an absolute moral code.

Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\n>as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\n \nYour example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality\nand politeness.  You might have said \"burp\", for burping and swearing carry\nabout the same stigma today.  If you are talking about \"taking the Lord's \nname in vain\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of \nhypocrisy than of varying moral codes.\n \nIf there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply\nabsolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes\ncould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for\nexample, God's code could include, \"Thou shalt not create Beings without\na hospitable planet to live on\", but this law would be inapplicable to us.\nNevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable\nto us are also applicable to God.\n \nBut when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have\na sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to\nfollow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category \"morality\"\ncan be sensibly applied.\n-- \n                                     James Owens  ad354@Freenet.carleton.ca\n                                     Ottawa, Ontario, Canada",

Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and\nLucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or\norganized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being \"offspring\" of\nGod has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \"born again\" of\nHim.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is\nhow language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a\nword is dangerous.\n\n\n>     This is really a red herring.

You did not refer to the Mormon belief\nthat Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We\nkeep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of\nMormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it.

The fact is that they are not.

Jesus didn't\ngo out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects\nto draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told\nanother not to say good bye to His family.

Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]\n>Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really\n>busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!\n\nHe directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of\nresponse to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.\n\nI pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and\nJim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to\nunderstand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't\nhave time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote\nout of context.  \n\nI asked Jim the following:\n>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for\n>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a\n>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?\n\nJim replied by saying \n>Did I either ask or assert that?\n\nBut today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject\n\"Silence is concurrence\":  \n\nm23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes:\n>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of\n>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual\n>may be held responsible for that action?\n\nWhich is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of\ncontext isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on\nt.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.\n\nDoes \"silence is concurrence\" imply that Jim thinks that because I\ndidn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes\nout of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this\nquestion; read what he has written and decide for yourself.\n\n\nBut back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next \ngambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he\nconcluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide\nthe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\nToday we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help\nmake it more clear, Jim), titled \"Inductive Logic\":\n\n>Scenario:\n>A white goose waddles past the door\n>A white goose waddles past the door\n>A white goose waddles past the door\n>...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)...\n>A black goose waddles past the door.

If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question \n>   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese?\n\nMore red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\nnumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \"axed\" his articles,\nbut not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\nWell, I can't see where he is going with this.\n\nBut I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80\narticles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with\nFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that\nthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt\nwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man\nargument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)\n\nThink hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it\nthrough your induction engine and see what pops out.  \n\ndj",

In fact, it is the combination of the two\nstatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to\ncharacterize that as \"ignoring\" the instruction to spread the\nword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\"\n\nOf course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \"instruction\nto spread the word.\"\n\nAll these quotes btw are from:\n\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>\n\n>in which, at the end, he claims I did not answer a question\n>which I answered, and which he deleted (to get the chronology\n>right, he deleted the answer and then said I didn't answer).\n\nAnd I claim it correctly, because my question went:\n\n\"Do you, too, measure\nthe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not\na whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\"\n\nand the closest Dean came to an answer was:\n\n\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,\nand generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that\nthe sport is all there is.\"\n\nOf course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts\nin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,\nyet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:\n\n\"So I now restore the answer to your question\nthat you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask\na nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really\ndoesn't take much sophistication to understand.\"\n\nOn top of which, I doubt that the \"answer\" is at all representative\nof Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's \nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\nOne wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all\nthis.\n\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\n\n\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\n\t\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nthe \"sins\" of other individuals.\"\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\n\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\n\nDean again:\n\n\"You made an ass of yourself\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\n\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\n\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\n\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\nthe basis of one insult after another.\n\nPeter Nyikos",

        "subject": "THE DIVINE MASTERS",
        "content": "THE DIVINE MASTERS       \n      \n               Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that \n          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God \n          into the physical world, God Incarnate. \n          \n               But there are some very important related facts that \n          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of \n          most other world religions. \n           \n               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-\n          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \n          after the life of Jesus. \n    \n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \n          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \n          teaching of REincarnation. \n       \n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \n          UNIVERSES.)                             \n\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \n      \n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \n          indicator for religious validity. \n    \n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \n          other major world religions, including Islam. \n     \n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \n          \"silver cord\". \n    \n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of \n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \n          Master. \n    \n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \n    \n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \n          Mat\" organization. \n      \n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \n    \n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \n          classic. \n    \n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \n          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \n          Jesus was. \n    \n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \n          Master. \n    \n          \n    \n          RE-INCARNATION\n          \n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \n          \n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \n          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, \n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \n          INCARNATION. \n\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \n\n\n\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\n\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \n          waiting for Jesus' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \n    \n          \n          \n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\n\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \n    \n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \n    \n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \n          \n          \n          \n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\n\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \n       \n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \n          CONTINUE. \n    \n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \n          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \"SOUL TRAVEL\") \n          REPLACE blind faith. \n    \n\n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (3 books, 2 addresses). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \n\n\n                                           Robert E.

        "subject": "Re: Freemasonry and the Southern Baptist Convention",
        "content": "There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among\nSouthern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and\nI suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily\nagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.\n\n *\n\nFor a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book\nclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.\n(Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the\nMasons.)\n\nThe SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,\nwhich studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\nfeeling that they were saying \"You got the wrong answer last time, try to\ndo better and get the answer we want.\")\n\nAnyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\nsuch as: \"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\"\n\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\nof Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Examples of\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\nare not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\naren't really in a place to speak on this last point.)\n\n\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\ninfluenced how the report came out.\n\n *\n\nThe information above was gleaned from \"The Religious Herald\", a publication\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \"Baptists Today\", which\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a\nbig issue among some Baptists.  8-)\n\nBecause I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are\nrelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.  Your\nmileage may vary.  Void where prohibited.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\nMilton:  \"We use only the finest baby frogs, dew picked and flown from Iraq,\n          cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then\n          sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk\n          chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose.\"\n\nPraline: \"That's as may be, it's still a frog.\"",

        "content": "In article <1746.2BD37A66@paranet.FIDONET.ORG> \nBill.Carlson@p0.f18.n104.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Bill Carlson) writes:\n> Since everywhere I look, Zoroaster is suggested as being a probable\n> descendant of Daniel; suppose you prove he wasn't.\n\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\n\nMAGI: \n\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\n\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \n(Gershevitch, 1964).\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\nhierarchy.\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\nof Central Asia.\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\nthat of the priesthood: white.\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\nmaster of himself.\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\npriesthood, would be very strange.\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\n\nSAOSHYANT:\n  The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\nstate of the world, when existence will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\"\n[See Frashokereti]\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (\"he who embodies truth\"), the son of\nthe Vispataurvairi (\"she who conquers all\"), is the third, who will make\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he who makes\ntruth grow,\" and Ukhshyatnemah, \"he who makes reverence grow\"; the names of the\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\nits roots to the same source.",

ALL of them.\n\n\t\tDon't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard\n\t\tequipment.\n\n\t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?\n\n\t\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This\n\t\t  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable\n\t\t  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.\n\n\t\t\t.... gotcha!\n\n\t\t  ... when in isolation from other substances.\n\n\t\t  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote\n\t\t  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \"this window,\n\t\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come\n\t\t  down\", and maintain a left to right sequence?\n\n\t\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when\n\t\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)\n\t\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to\n\t\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long\n\t\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend\n\t\t  to ignite.\n\n\t\t\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics?\n\t\t\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?\n\n\t\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation\n\t\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made\n\t\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature\n\t\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain\n\t\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length\n\t\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).\n\n\t\t\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes.\n\t\t\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),\n\t\t\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why\n\t\t\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open\n\t\t\tto the outside?).\n\n\t\t\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the\n\t\t\tcompound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones\n\t\t\tare missing?\n\n\tDo I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.\n\tYou trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?\n\t\tIN advance of a Court?  God help us.\n\t\t\t(For we are surely not helping ourselves).\n\tYou trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?\n\n\t\tYou are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.\n\t\tLook again.\n\n\tDid it happen that way?

The thief on the \n     cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of \n     the righteous dead.

As the punctilious scholars have written\nmany volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,\nhere we will briefly point out only the general category\ninto which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted\nas accurate reports.\n    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad\n(SAW) fall into two main categories:  \n\n    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal \nevents that happened at the time of his birth, or before his \ndeclaration of prophethood.  \n\n    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences \nof the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: \n\n    1) Those wonders that were manifested after\nhis departure from this world in order to confirm his\nprophethood, and \n\t2) Those that he exhibited during the era\nof his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  \n\t2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest\nin his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral\nconduct and perfection, and \n    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  \nThe last part again has two branches:  \n\t2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and \n\t2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last \nbranch is again divided into two categories:  \n\t2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings \nthat occured during his mission either to break the \nstubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the\nfaith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different\nsorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of\nwater from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with\na little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals\nEach of these sons has also many instances, and thus\nhas, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by\nconsensus.  \n\t2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this\nincludes events lying in the future that occured as he had\npredicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting\nfrom the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)\n\n(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended\nwithout choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could\nnot completely conform to the order of this classification.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.",

Brian K., so far,\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\n\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\nhis set of excuses.  \n\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\n\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see\nthe dialog:\n\n\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \n\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\n\nBK:  \"No.\"\n\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\n     the oncoming truck.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\n\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\n\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\n\n\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \n\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\n\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\nBrian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \n\nThank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.  (My\nwife tells me the same thing at times.)   :-)   I will try to do better.",

What Peter says about God is what\nthe Bible says.   \n\n\nConsider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of\nyears, various people come up and testify of their experience with the\nliving God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,\nonce the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes\nDavid, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King \nNebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes\nNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent\ntakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use\nto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up\ncomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.\nUp comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS\nagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years\nwith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself\n\"I am.\" \n\nWhile you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that\nKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known\nMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these\npeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet\nall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells\nof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is\ndifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly\nreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.\nWhat Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of\nBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different\nperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\ndares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's\ntestimony, even though different from those prior, consistently\ndescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  \n\nNow.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic\non the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  \"I am\".  He has\nrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).\nPlease believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.\n\nAre you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \nAre you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\nshepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\nprogrammers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\ncomplete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\nthat is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\ndisplay of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\nKing Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincolnr?",

Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never\ndemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he\njust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of\ncommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.\n\nBut even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the\nverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,\nwhich is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only\nhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all\nstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with\nthat: substitute \"Moslem\" or \"Buddhist\" or \"Satanist\" instead of\n\"Christian\", and it means the same thing.\n\nChristanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.

If, as you say,\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\nusing the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.\n \n> In the long run, the advantage of making such a literary/moral\n> analysis is that it will save band-width between Christians and\n> non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of\n> the stuff on these (pornographic) groups.\n\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\nall are.

Either there is value in a\n> particular work, or there is not whether one is a Christian or\n> not.\n\nHm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to\ndiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I\nstart off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\nhave their faces uncovered.\n\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \n                                                                         \n> In support for the first assumption:\n> \n> The Christian scriptures say this:\n\n\t(Evidence deleted)\n\nI'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \"The Word\nof God\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for\na person who shares your beliefs.\n\nStill, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could\nbe interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.\n\n>                                                                        \n>              **************************************\n> \n> NOW THEN what are some of the major themes/motifs in the\n> pornographic literature on places like alt.sex.stories?

I would hope that people relize that this is\nnot necessarily true.\n                     \n> \n> Motif #3 -- ONE'S DICK IS ONE'S INSTRUMENT OF REDEMPTION.  \n                    ^^^^\n      Might I suggest the word \"penis\"? It seems more in line with the tone of\nyour post. \n          \n>      Blessed are those who are well-hung, for they shall get\n>      laid. -- from what would thus be a revised Matthew 5 :-).\n> \n\nBravo!  I respect you and your sense of humor, sir. \n\n> \n> Motif #4 -- SEX AS AN EXPRESSION OF SINCERE GIVING.  \n>                                                  \n> There is, often enough, a clear desire on the part of the\n> protagonist, to give (definitely sexual) pleasure to the object\n> (person) of his/her desires.\n                                                 \nYes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However,\nthey are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf\nSternberg, for example.\n\n> \n> Motif #5 -- ALT.SEX.STORIES DESCRIBES A SEX WHICH IS COMPLETELY\n> REMOVED FROM THE REALM OF \"TRANSMITTING LIFE\"  \n> \n> So removed is sex from its procreative dimension on\n> alt.sex.stories, that one begins to wonder why sex even involves\n> ejaculation, as in the context described in pornography it serves\n> then no real purpose.  \n\nIt serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the\nvirility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the\ncharacter) has orgasmed.                      \n\n> The Whole Picture [TM] is probably very well described by the\n> Catholic teaching on this: Of the husband and wife, in an act of\n> total mutual self-giving in the sexual union, cooperating with\n> God in opening themselves up for the transmission of new life\n> (cf. Humane Vitae).  \n\nYour Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your\nchurch.\n         \nIn addition, if sex is for procreation, then\n\n1)\tWhy did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it,\nrather than building it in as instinct?\n2)\tWhy did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in\npregnancy, even among Catholics.

There\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \n\n> But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\n> society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?

These commandments\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \n\n> And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\n> *different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).

There are *many*\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \n\n-*----\n> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\ngospel.\n\n> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\n> tell you something about Christianity? ...\n\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\nshouldn't do. \n\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\nmake Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\nChristian interpretation.  \n\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\nlukewarm we should spit out. \n\nRussell",

They had advertised that\nthey were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the room\nof the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went to\nthe lecture.\n\nThere were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one\nwoman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of\nthem. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read\nstraight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he\nlacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy\nread, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The\nfirst guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and\nthat they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars\n(English?) from the thirteenth century.\n\nThe other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a\nfairy-tale teller's voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to\nme. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something.\nWhat made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all\ncontained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,\nthen that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,\nbut if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I've\nread too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks\nabout in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your\nfriends_ in _Prometheus rising_. \n\nIt was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding\nthe actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to\nbe a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more\ndistance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain\npower and admiration. He spoke like a fairy-tale teller, whenever he\nremembered. ;)\n\nThe information brochure is at home.

Whether or not there is some \"right\"\ninterpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to\nread the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it was\nMichael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural\ninfluence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, but\nregardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point\nof contention between Michael and myself. \n\nI have argued -- beyond Michael's claims -- that the Christian\nscriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a\nwide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their\nmost important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that\nthere is some \"right\" interpretation *unless* there is a way to\ndetermine what that \"right\" interpretation is.  It is the lack of\nan objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that\nputs the force behind the line I argue.\n\n> Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian\n> glasses.

He is willing to live and practice his religion\nwithin this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that\nmuch of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by\nideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have\ncalled conservative must also interpret, but they do not\nrecognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and\nimportance of this.\n\n> Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's\n> theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;\n> Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?'

The purely Christian\nprinciples that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in\nthe Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian\nscripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his\npolitical stances.  That one should love one's neighbor is a \npurely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance \nfor homosexuality is *not*.\n\nAs to these political stances, they are often at odds with what\nis commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I \nsuspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other\nhand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these \npolitical stances become most influential when presented to \nthose who need them most.)\n\n-*----\n> This is a theological statement worthy of Barth.\n> Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)\n\nHaving barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I\ndoubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!\n\nRussell",

The Greeks had a love of wisdom, philo sophos, and\nthis great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library.

We do them regardless.  \n\nKent Sandvik responds:\n\n> Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you \n> have to feel guilty . . . \n\nI think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn't view\nguilt like our modern venacular colors it.   \n\n\"Feelings\" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of \nbeing guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a \nreaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the \nreaction.   Let me give you an example:\n\nHave you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a\nlittle white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really \ndidn't know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?\nAre you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You\nare guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  \nFeelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus's use of the word\n\"guilt\" as how a court uses it.\n\nJesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being\nimperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do\nbad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our \nguilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. \nWe are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is\nnot a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us\nsinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a\nhuman being.  Guilty as charged.\n\n> and then there's this single personality that will save you from this\n> universal guilt feeling.\n\nYou can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you\nmade a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in\nthe meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the\nway Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.\n\nOr two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself\nand feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to\nsay a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way \nJesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this \ncategory to some extent in their lives.\n\nJesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt\nfeeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he\nloves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That\nisn't new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize \nthat this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.\nThat is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to \nhave your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.\nJesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present\nsinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  \n\nGod is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into\na round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to\nchange our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.\nGod has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in\nJesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will\nmove it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very\nbeing--and us and God communicate with each through his\nunifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For\nwith the divine nature living within us, we can now see\nour imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With\nthe power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power\nto help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives \nwithin us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before\nwe could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now \nhave authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine \nnature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit\nis eternal.\n\nThe relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because\nit is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to\nheavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.\nRemember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he\nseparated the \"goats from the sheep\".   Many people in the\nlast day will ask him, \"Didn't I prophesy in your name and do\nmiracles, and do good things in your name?\"   And what did Jesus say?\n\"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.\"  That is the cornerstone of \nChristianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your \nrelationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will\nbe counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  \n\n> Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,\n> I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this\n> huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.\n\nGood.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you\nlove yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus\ntaught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, \nin the common english venacular, \"feeling guilty\" has a\ndifferent meaning than the state of guilt.\n\n> This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain\n> personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain\n> religious doctrines. And if your personality type is \n> opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain\n> world view system.\n\nI believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,\na lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.\n\n> There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice\n> thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,\n> the shoulders feel far more relaxed!\n\nYes.  You have stated what Jesus said.  Remember?  \"Come to me,\ntake my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light.\"  A yoke\nis used to direct oxen to do work.  Once you have a relationship with \nJesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life.  Having \nGod at your side is of great advantage.",

        "subject": "Objectivity (was: After 2000 years...)",
        "content": "This discussion on \"objective\" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the\nrecent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually\nobserve phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is\n\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\nand the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\ndefinition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\n\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\n    observable phenomenon.\n\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \n\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\n\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \n\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\nmanner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone's face,\"\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\nmorality. \n\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\nevidence.\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    In starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one's\n    point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be\n    simple and dignified.\n\t\t\t\tDiogenes",

It does not mean\nthat Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss\nwere not.  I agree that this is a \"heresy\".  So what?  \nThe sweating of blood in Gethsemene is\nnot a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement\nin Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.  \nAs far as the \"unpardonable sin\" whatever that is, it is Biblical,\nand not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against\nthe Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative\nones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same.\nI'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't\nknow what you mean by \"That He needed to be saved\".  Jesus?\nJehovah?  Elohim?

Brian *IS* inside.  The Bible and the information contained therein\nare outside the wall.   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the\nabsurd things he says.

Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\nHeaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\nobsolete by Jesus.\n\nIf anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\nfollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\nthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He\nalso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived\ninterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their\nheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness\nmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom\nof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their\nway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.\nThey had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the\nletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  \n\nI think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\nmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\nin it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nChristianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\nperspectives and personal conduct.

The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is\nresponsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and\nthus \"objective\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.\nHowever, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is \n\"good\") is subjective.\n\nI think that the problem here is one of word usage.

Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\n\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\n\n\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\n\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\n\n\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\n\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\n\n\nAnd in John 3:16:\n\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\n   life.\"\n\n\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.\n\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\n\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\n\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\n\n-------------------------------\nBrian Ceccarelli\nbrian@gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu",

Who \"tosses out\"\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\nascribes this more broadly.\n\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\nthis way by a critical reader.\n\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\nit bit him on the keister twice.\n\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\nauthor's history of whatever.)\n\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\nthe text provide evidence?\n\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\nthan teach history.\n\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's \"Historian's Fallacies\"\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\nto read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy\nto read.  Give it a try.\n\nRussell",

        "content": "Hello Ceci:\n\n     My name is Tony and I have a few comments on your \"rosicrucian\"\nadventure. I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in\nany Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word \"Rosicrucian\" in the \nname of the organization. I only claim having done some \"homework\" :-)\n\n     This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems\ndifferent, it's my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. Heck,\nEnglish may be my second language! (And then again maybe not by now :-)\n\n     I proceed:\n>\n>I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at\n>least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday.\n>\n     Let's start with the name \"Rosicrucian\". I took me a long time to come\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\nsome 'rosicrucians' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves\nrosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\n\n     I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\n\n     Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they\ndescend (at least in part) from what was the \"Gold-und-Rosenkreuz\" (Golden\nand Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two \"Golden and Rosy\nCross\", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with\nMasonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).\n\n     \"You'll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \n\n>The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and\n>that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars\n>(English?) from the thirteenth century.\n>\n     Again, instead of R:s, it should be \"Lectorium Rosicrucianum\" :-). It\nis curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-\nsectarian*.\n\n     The Cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged\nthe 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the\n12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the\ncrusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the\nworldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church's\nunseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northern\nItaly, then throughout the south of France.\n\n\n>What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all\n>contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,\n>then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,\n>but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss.\n\n     I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with \"us containing\nsomething divine\"... And yes I don't like phrases like \"eternal bliss\"\neither! :-)\n\n>How to robotize people and brainwash...\n>\n     For a moment I thought you were referring to Madison Ave :-)\n(Madison avenue in New York City is where the most influential (read\n$$$) *commercial* advertising is produced here in the USA :-)\n\nPeace,\n\nTony\n\n\nBTW, I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you free\nof charge.",

This is true in\nexactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in\nZeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophies\nfrom many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same\nway as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts.\nAtheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians\nbase theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.\n\nThe \"weak atheist\" position is logically extremely assailable -- any\nlogical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it\nas soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak\natheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with\nattempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail\nmiserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the\n\"strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist\" position do so on this\nbasis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments\npresented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound;\ntherefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do\nnot exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are\ndefined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of\npopular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite\nquestionable. \n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.

Also, you do not know exactly\nwhat Jesus means by eternal life.  \n\nBrian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics\nbook and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding\nmaterial?  Why do you such with the Bible?  For an idea what Jesus\nmeans by the world, look up references to it in your concordance.  For\na good description, the whole Book of Ecclesiastes is game.  For \neternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that\neternal life is quite different than what you think.

Did your style start feeling a\n>bit cramped?\n\nYes, that's exactly what I felt.  My heart just felt that what I was\nbeing taught was *wrong* -- a basically good message, but framed in\nerrors.  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were\nsomehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are \"guilty\" of their\nlifestyle, that pride in one's work is a bad thing, that Jesus died\nfor me -- I don't want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an\nimpersonal act where the person can't possibly even *know* me well\nenough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not.\n\nI was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good\nthing.  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message\nof Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I'm just not compatible with\nChristianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I\ncan't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you\ndescribe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.\n\n>I know how that goes.  Knowing I couldn't and didn't want to \n>live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me\n>outside, too.  \n\nDon't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I\ndon't believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder --\nnot because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren't*\nin my character.  You may think there's nothing keeping me from just\nrunning around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I'm able,\ninsulting people for the heck of it, because I'm not answerable to\nanyone; but you'd be wrong.  I'm answerable to myself.  A life like\nthat would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.\n\n>'Till I met the Man, that is.\n\nMy initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching\nand a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of\nGod with me.  I finally decided that I had once \"felt\" this presence\njust as I had \"felt\" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a\nlittle tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I\nhad believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as\nsomething of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.\n\nSince then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your\nsupernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in\nmy darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for\na moment and called out to whatever's out there, because I want to\nknow the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I\nhave not yet received an answer.\n\n>= Only when I truly listened to myself, body and soul, did I realize\n>= that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being\n>= Christian.  There is a higher truth in the universe, and Christianity\n>= just ain't it.\n>\n>Any suggestions on what (or who or where) it might be, and why?\n\nNope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the\nuniverse may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional\nuniverse may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same\nway you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional\nsphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts\non this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four-\ndimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck\nin a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables\nbecome too much for us to even speculate on.\n\nThat is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to\nbe, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor\nhad anything to do with it.\n\n>\"OK,\" you may say. \"So now, if I'm just being good, am I doing good enough?\"\n>\n>That's for you to answer.  If you feel you're doing fine, then go ahead and\n>ignore us foolish little Christians.  We can present what we've seen and\n>experienced (providing our witness), but it isn't up to us to make that seed\n>sprout.  \n\nChristians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy\nbook, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt\ntrips, insinuations that I'm without morals, arguments from disbelief\n(\"how can you possibly believe that God *doesn't* exist?\"), and so\nforth.  All I'm asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced,\nbut it's not going to be easy.\n\n>So much as you don't like what we're \"selling\", there just may be someone\n>out there that can identify with it.  Methinks you could give us all a \n>lesson in tolerance and back off.\n\nHaving had years upon years of contact with your religion from both\nthe inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It\npreys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it's\ngot these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly\nintolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you'll say\nthat your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judge\nChristianity from the Christians I know.\n\nI feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's\nself, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason\nthan that.\n\nSo I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some\npeople think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly\nvalid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity\nwhatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to\nrealize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy,\nfulfilled life.\n\nI have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice\nthings.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses\nis that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and\nthey know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to\nbelieve, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think\nany less of people who don't agree with them.\n\n>Obviously, the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the\n>Christian's faith is far from conclusive, notwithstanding how vehemently we\n>propose otherwise.\n\nPrecisely my point.

There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship.\nParents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that \nchildren can do whatever they want?  NOT!  Part of being a parent means\nadministering punishment when the child is at fault.  Part of being a \nparent means giving instruction.  God tests us through the trial of\nlife such that we may grow stronger.  He teaches what is right and \nwhat is wrong.  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us,\nbe it Heaven or be it Hell.  If God did not follow through with what\nHe has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent.\n\nIn parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through\nwith it, the children will not take that parent's words very seriously.\nGod does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and\nwhat not to do.  By life's trials, we see the folly of doing our own\nwill rather than His.  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting\nHim when it comes time for Judgement.

        "content": "I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and\nthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their\nstupidity and lies.    \n\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\n\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \nwondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\nFirst, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\ndidn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\nit.\n\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\n\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\nsaid:\n\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise\nDavid Koresh.\"\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\npart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\n\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.

The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as\nofficers and yelling \"Police\" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug\nhouses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and\ndisplay of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it's\na sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even\nfight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so\ncommonly, now would it?\n\nWhether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my\npoint, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear\njudgement on this issue.\n\nI merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day.\nFurthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending\npotentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police\nalways knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have\nbeen allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  Just what should the police do\nwhen apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they\nreasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which\ncan't be faked by the \"competition\"?\n\nEven if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not an\nexcuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD's, there was almost definitely\nat most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops.\n-- \n*Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)\t*       ___\n*\t\t\t\t\t* _____/_o_\\_____\n*\tTwinkle, twinkle, little .sig,\t*(==(/_______\\)==)\n*\tKeep it less than 5 lines big.\t* \\==\\/     \\/==/",

I never said that the Law was made\n: obsolete by Jesus.\n\nJust for reference, here's the earlier quote:\nMalcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9\nand Deuteronomy 22:20-25:\n: These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had\n: expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a\n: direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God\n: is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately\n: punishable.\n: Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to\n: God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in\n: the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There\n: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And\n: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew\n: and Gentile alike.\n\nThese are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the\nother is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on\nan issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change\nwas made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus\nchange that?\n\n: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\n: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\n: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.\n\nSure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning\nnon-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to\ndeny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?\n\n: I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\n: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\n: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nI'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible\nfrom end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this\nknowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and\nback it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David\nKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if\nthey actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly\nmade the means look frightening.\n\nHowever, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but\nbelieve every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far\nmore of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy\nto manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough\nto debate with these people.\n\n: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\n: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\n\nNo, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told\nme how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will\nby doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to\nobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to\ntwo millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it\nwith my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing\nthe will of God.\n\n: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is\n: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\n\nWell, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about\neternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from\nthe god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.\n\n: God be with you,\n\nNot yours, thanks ;)\n\n: Malcolm Lee  :)\n\nRob Lanphier\nlanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu\nlanph872@uidaho.edu\n\nAnd for the curious, here is my earlier post:\n> Hmm, for a book that only applied to the Israelites (Deuteronomy), Jesus sure\n> quoted it a lot (Mt 4: 4,7,10).

What's happening is that that the term \"Taoism\" is becoming\ncompletely polluted and trivialized like the words \"magic\", \"Alchemy\", \n\"Zen,\" etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they \nwant. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled \"The\nTao of\" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptions\nlike the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)\n\nAny other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them. On balance,\nI say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may.

        "content": "Why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to Christians, why do *we*)\nwant to find \"commandments\" in the books regarded as scripture?  What's\ngoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\nenough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\n\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\n\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\n\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\n\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\nevangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\n\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\n\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\n[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\n\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\nhow it was said: 'You must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy.  But I\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\ndoes NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\nChristians.\n\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\neven (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don't\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\n\nLet's move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\n\"equivalent\" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\n\n\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\n\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\n\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\n\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\nour understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\n\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\n\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\n\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew's\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\nof the synoptic tradition?\n\nI'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into \nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]\n-- \nMichael L.

The problem with a \"moment of\nsilence\" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of \"allowing\" for religion\namongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need\nmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are\nrequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also\nhas requirements that are not addressed by this.\n\nThere is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in\nthis \"moment of silence\" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that\nChristian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \nbeing able taking note of it.)\n\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\n\"mainstream\" religion.\n\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\ndoesn't NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\n\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\non non-Christians.\n\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, I\nsuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --\nit is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in \"making\"\ntheir children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach\nwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in\nthe world to do so.\n\nIf you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of\nsilence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment\nwill only embarrass you.  Give it up.\n-- \nMichael L.

There is no hidden\nagenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an\neasy and as straight forward as it reads.\n\nKent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you.\nAnd it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone.\nMe, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one\nsees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with \nwhether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  \n\nJesus uses the word \"men\".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.\nJesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.\nChristians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian \nis just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian \ncan see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought\nout into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been\nexposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't\nseen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been\nexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your\nown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the\nHoly Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can\nshine light into places inside us where we didn't even know\nexisted. \n\nSo do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians\nare not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the\nLight of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,\nand they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far\nwe have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to\nknow how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants\nto know?

Ego verses the truth,\nwhich do you choose?\n\n>I'm watching the news about a man who saw the light, and made\n>sure that the 19 children burned to death as part of his insight\n>into the light. I don't think the world is that simple. And if \n>you act in such ways when you are enlighted, then I'm a happy\n>man and I pray I will never receive such 'light'.\n\nAnd I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, \nwho made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part\nof his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who\ndied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was\ntheir downfall to death. \n\nAnd Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an\nexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.\nDavid Koresh was no light and no excuse for\nyou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who\nclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh\nwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\n\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\nKoresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \n\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\nmother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\nright from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.\nThey wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\ncost them a lot.\n\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\ndidn't work with Jesus.  \n\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\nKoresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?\nWho was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what\nSatan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did\nnot Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?

As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the\ndestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?\n\nAs far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples\nof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have\nbrought death, disease, (i.e. the \"downwinders\") and environmental contami-\nnation.

I grant you that when\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most of\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like it\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\nappears, those of David Koresh.\n\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The\n\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\n\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\n\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\n\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\n\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\n\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\n#\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\n\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn't \"splinter\"\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\n\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.

I am\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\n\n#\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.

Though J.

Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\nof honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\n\n#        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\n\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's \"orders\" (the late\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\nopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile maze\nin Utah).\n\n#        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.

There, runners from around the world\nwere gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.\n\nFrom there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over\nseventy countries for a series of concurrent international or\ncross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada,\nJapan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe.

But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some \nreferences.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where \nLane Fox writes, \"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' \ncareer] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\"\n\nIn my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21\nApril 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine \nPagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \"A comment *attributed* to\nJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\n\nSo far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: \n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \nI don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\norginally developed (does anyone?).\n\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The\nformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and\nideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I \ndidn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to\nincorporate theology).\n\nCan't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before \nGutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one \nhand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,\nbecause anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is \ncertainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have \nthe two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic \nms.  But here the ms. date is critical.\n\n:-)\n\nRich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota",

I'm asking because this whole thread got started\nbecause I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,\nbasically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a \nclarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of\nevolution_ has a very different meaning to me.\n>\n>[description of atomic theory, and alternative theories of gravity, deleted]\n>>Both are very useful models that \n>>have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you \n>>want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly \n>>the way the theory now formulated talks about it.\n>\n>Here is where you fail to make an important distinction.

Again, it may be because I feel stronger\nabout separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_\nproposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves\nare the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not \nthe things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered \nfact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle \nsystems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original \npoint, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only \nthe mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_\natoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough\nto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being \nany clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:\n\n   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)\n      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational\n        evidence (your way)\n\n   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it\n        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence \n\tand it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can\n        be made.

        "content": "There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\n\nThis doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?\"\n\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\nit is not.\n\n\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\nJohn E King:\n\n> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the\n> area[.]\n\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\nbe rebuilt\", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\nto get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\npopulation' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\n\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\n\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\nit is hardly a `clear implication'.\n\n\nMr King also writes:\n\n> So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\n> Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards\n> we are talking about a one-horse town.\n\nWell, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\nit's at least a two-horse town.\n\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it's still 22,000 people\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\n\n\nAnd you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\n\nLet's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\n\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\n\n *\n\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\n\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\n\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\nwalls.\n\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\"[Do] You know why I'm the enabler?

        "content": "From: NUNNALLY@acs.harding.edu (John Nunnally)\n\n> When are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question? \n> \n> In paraphrase: \n> \n> On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they\n> are above the Law and above the Prophets (7 major and 12 minor) and not \n> accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion \n> in Matthew 5:14-19? What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is\n> the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?\n\nOK, here's at least one Christian's answer:\n\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\nGod's purposes.\n\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \n\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\n\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \nJesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \nGod's Law.\n\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\n\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \nLaw in this way:\n\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \nin Christ Jesus.\n\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \nserved it's purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \nas Christ said he would do.\n\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\nre-expressed in Christianity. \n\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and \nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \nrepresenting Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\nThe Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\nActs 20:7)\n\nOK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\n\nPlease excuse the long posting.  Thanks for your interest if you have read \nthis far...\n\nJohn Nunnally\nNunnally@acs.Harding.edu",

        "content": "Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\n     when questioning? \n\nI've often found it to be the case that the theist\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     \"being.\"  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\n     of God's existence and question it impartially?\n     \nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n\n\n--",

The\n     answer lies in the location of \"paradise\" when Jesus died.\n\n     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.\n\n     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and \n     Lazarus as \"Abraham's Bosom,\" to which the godly beggar Lazarus was\n     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus\n     \"Abraham's Bosom\" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed\n     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection.\n\n     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of \n     hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith\n     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven\n     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or\n     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with\n     the Father.\n\n     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the\n     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But\n     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene\n     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then\n     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise\n     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in\n     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: \"Ascending on high, He led captivity\n     captive; He gave gifts unto men.\" Verse 9 continues: \"But what does `He\n     ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the\n     earth?\" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: \"He who descended is the same\n     as He who ascended above all the heavens.\" Presumably He led the whole\n     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of\n     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.\n\nra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is\nra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to\nra> \"look at the Bible\" in order to see the truth, but what of those who\nra> see Biblical things differently from you?\n\n     I think that this characterization is faulty.

Even\nif they do that is *MANY YEARS* in the future--until which they are a burden\non someone, or society.  There is also the matter of the mother.  Forcing\nher to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent\nher from being a productive member of society.\n\n>>Actually, I was refering to the minority that objects to abortion, not\n>>those who object to federal funding.

It is \n>discriminatory that I cannot make that choice, and so you must pay for it.\"  \n\n>That a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or \n>otherwise that someone else should Foot the Bill [sic] for that choice.\n\nOk, look.  It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will\ntake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice\nC.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd have\nto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they\ntake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next\n18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay\nfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen\nnot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid\nfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in\nconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly\nlegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded\nbut some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money going\nto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those\nwomen who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice\nB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see any\nreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing\npersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is\nwhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*\nis what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,\nand that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your\n\"taxes\" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being\n*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your\nobjections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,\nas I'm sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in that\narea can help out in another--like our massive debt.)\n\n\n>>If you disagree then give us some \"reasons\".

Uncle Bill doesn't pay for \n>breast augmentation, facelifts, etc...  Why abortions?  It's elective \n>surgery!  \n\nThose other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savings\nin other procedures that would be required down the road without them.\n(In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)\nThis is quite different from the case of abortion.\n\n>As for your argument, you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making \n>it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too, SO YOU \n>ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS!

Your kind of double-\n>talk really makes me ill.\n\nThis is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing \"to make the alternative affordable\ntoo\".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*\nyour statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn't.\nIf Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left\nit out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also be\nquite surprised.\n\n\n>\"Pro-choice\".  Ha!  Pro-Abortion really fits in your case.\n\nYes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.\n\n>If you're gonna fund one choice, you have to fund them all, at the very \n>least.\n\nYOU STUPID FUCK!  *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices.  *YOU* are the\none who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices.\n\n>        IMHO if we fund the adoption choice right, (meaning not just \n>throwing money at it but cutting costs, esp. legal costs) we won't need \n>abortion anymore.\n\nYour humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is still\nthe fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young woman\ncould need to be getting an education.  (like finishing High School, entering\ncollege, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder to\ndo if you have to \"take a break\" for a few months...things that have a massive\nimpact on her future productivity.)\n\n\n>>have a \"right to life\".

There are people who convert from\nnon-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (I\ndon't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be an\ninteresting thing to know.)  I think that religion is a crutch.  People are\nnaturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't want\nto believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there is\nnothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.\nReligion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things\nscience has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of\nsecurity... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.\nThat they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  This\nhas a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these\npeople are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their\nbelief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind of\nuseless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy with\ntheir fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too\n(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept\nthe harsh reality that they are running from).\n\nAnyway, I'm getting kind of carried away here.  But my point is that theism\ndoesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow\nup as a theist (although this happens far too often).

I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is\na reasonable assumption. \n\n>And who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\n>are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\n>reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\n\nMichael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian\nglasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the\nNT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some\npoints in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly \nabrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with\nadequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew,\nand probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) )\n\nThis part is, I discover, what most moves me to post:\n\nmls> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n>No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \n>seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\n>gospel.\n\nRussell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate.\nMichael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal, \nwhich seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are \npossible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Merton\nwas a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Francis\nwas a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed?\n\nmls> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\nmls> tell you something about Christianity? ...\n\nMichael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have\ntwo hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) )\nRussell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's\ntheological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;\nDean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' More\ndirect, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?'\nThe implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the \ntradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your idea\nof the tradition doesn't include him, Change your idea of the tradition!\n\n>The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\n>se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\n>gays.  \n\nHow can one answer this while staying on the more general issue?\nI'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael)\non this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement.\n\nOne verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, from\nPaul (of all people):\n\n'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28\n{I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry \nthem in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...' \n(roughly, from Romans). [If Russell would promise to convert based\non these or any other verses,  I'd promise to get the full context\nfor any that he requires :-) :-)]\n\n>In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\n>make Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\n>be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\n>Christian interpretation.  \n\nThis conclusion does not follow, even in short, from the\nargument that goes before.

Or are the allegations just part of the Big\n> Cover-Up?\n\nThank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being\na Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a\nconviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the \"fundy\" part as the\nterm fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to\nthose who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and\nwish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it\nmatter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been\nsatisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling\nstruggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.\n\nWith respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you\nto re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume\nthat defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his\nright to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'\ntheology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-\nDavidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect\nof the tragic events of the past few days.\n\nNor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the\nfederal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting\ninfants so it must be true even though such allegations do not\nfall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are\nstate and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the\nlocal level by proper authorities with no successful charge having\never been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent\nas Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least\nthat's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-\ngandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a\nlustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might\nbring upon him.  \n\nBut evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the\nbuilding in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined\nby qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse\nand none was found.

They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure.\nThey may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the \nBoobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of \nSatanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is \nknown.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the \nMasons have already fired back in their own magazines against the \nBoobtist Witch-hunt.\n  Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with \ntheir war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on \ntheir Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and \nmore Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a \nhandful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop \n'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.\n  So as far as I am concerned, the louder, ruder, and more outrageous \nan Anti-Masonic Crusade these old goats mount, the better.\n\nPop some pocorn and get a center row seat.

I took me a long time to come\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\nsome 'rosicrucians' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves\nrosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThis makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions.\nThere is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people\nwho call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually\n*BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important\nrequirements about not belonging to other 'religions'.  I find that\nthe ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be\ninterpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that\n'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'Perennial\nPhilosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>\n\n\nTony:\n\nI'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\n\n\nResponse:\n\nCertainly true.  I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves\n'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC.  Sure, I've heard all the\nhubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these\nWestern esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'.\nI'll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>\n\n\nTony:\n\n\"You'll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \n\n\nResponse:\n\nThis may be slightly off.  I've met some of these Rosicrucians and have\na couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I've heard and the slight contact\nI've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received with\nany kind of warm welcome.

Similarly, a moral relativist will not judge one moral system\nto be better than another in every possible circumstance.  This does not,\nhowever, preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another\nin a specific set of circumstances.  Nor does it preclude a set of moral\nrelativists from collectively judging a moral system, from some set of\ncircumstances which they all agree they are in.\n\n>                             And even that statement assumes an\n> objective reality independent of our beliefs about it.\n\nEh?

As for statements inside the\nBible, things are still not that clear, we don't have any indications\nfor instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament, one of the \nfew books that actually talks about Satan. Jobs is very much out\nof line with the rest of the OT books, and there's a chance that\nsomeone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures.\n\n> Now in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a different\n> matter.

You have to understand\nthe mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical\nrelativist. If you don't understand the underlying concepts, it is \npretty hard to continue with a dialogue. I'm not a perfect Christian,\nhowever about 20+ years of Christian teaching should have provided\nme with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame.\n\nCheers,\nKent\n\n---\nsandvik@newton.apple.com.

If they\nare arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea\nbargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will\nbe charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drug\ndealers have guns for protection from their customers and other\ncriminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids\nbecause the criminals aren't aware that they are cops.\n\nNo-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to\nend in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not\ncommitted any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house\ncannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.

In this case the no-knock warrant was not called\nfor.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF could\nhave surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have driven\nup to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and\nserved the warrant usual way.

Let's consider some \"personal interpretations\"\nand see how much trust we should put in \"Orthodox Mormonism\", which\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\n\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\nMcConkie said they \"thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\nMessiah.\" He also said Christians are wrong to believe \"that Jehovah is\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father],\" and that Christ \"came into\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\n\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\n\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\nexamining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\n\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\n\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\n\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\n\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'...\" (Articles of Faith,\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\n\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\n\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\n\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\n\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\nMcConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\n\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\n  Messianic prophecy?\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\n  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\n  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\n  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\n\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\n\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\nwhich reads:\n\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\n\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\n\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\n\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\n\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\nthe Father.\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\n  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\n  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\n  Messiah, p. 532)\n\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's \"arrest and\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\n\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\n\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\n\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\nwill be considered in this examination.\n\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\n\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in\nChrist's death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\n\n        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.\n        110:4.\n\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\n  says: \"The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\n  p. 450)\n\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\n\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\n     (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\nhim [Christ]...\"\n\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\nverses.\n\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\nthese Scriptures:\n\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\n\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\n\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\n\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\nthe Messiah.\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\n\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\n\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\n\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\n\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\n\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\n\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. \"The\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\n\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\n\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\n\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\n\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\n\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\n\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\n\n        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\nScriptures prove this fact:\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\n\n  \"...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\n  son... (Zech. 12:1,10)\n  Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,\n  and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)\n\n  \"...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.\n  43:3)\n  ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)\n\n  \"And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of\n  the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)\n  \"...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)\n\n  \"Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his\n  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)\n  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.\n  22:12)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with\n  thee. (Zech. 14:5)\n  \"...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1\n  Thess. 3:13)\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)\n  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)\n\n  \"...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...\n  (Ezek. 34:15-16)\n  ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\n  (Luke 19:10)\n\n  \"For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy\n  Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)\n  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great\n  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and\n  Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;\n  Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and\n  Rev. 3:19)\n\n        While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" they\nare wrong when they say He is not \"Elohim.\" The Bible reveals that\n\"Jehovah\" is the only true \"Elohim\" there is; all others are false.\nRemember, \"Jehovah\" is the personal name of the triune God who has\nrevealed Himself in the Bible.\n\n        Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that \"Jehovah\" and\n\"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note\nthat not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as \"Jehovah\"\nand \"Elohim\" but so is the Holy Spirit.\n\n  \"Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I\n  will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my\n  laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And\n  their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)\n  (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" and \"said\" added)\n  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a\n  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...\n  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;\n  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will\n  forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.\n  31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy\n  men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)\n  (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" added)\n  \"The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in\n  my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)\n\n        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that\n\"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.\n\n  \"And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,\n  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,\n  Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie\n  acknowledged that \"it was\" Christ's \"voice that spoke to Moses in the\n  burning bush...\" Promised Messiah, p. 394]\n  And the LORD [Jehovah] said...\n  And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the\n  children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your\n  fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his\n  name? what shall I say unto them?\n  And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus\n  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto\n  you.\n  And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto\n  the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your\n  fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and\n  the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for\n  ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod.\n  3:4,7,13-15)\n\n  \"And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD\n  [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2)\n\n  \"I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God\n  [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:\n  (Isa. 45:5)\n\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\n  [Elohim], and an everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10)\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\n  beside me there is no God [Elohim].

(Ps.\n  68:4) [Regarding the word \"Jah,\" Bruce R. McConkie stated: \"Jah\n  (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all\n  of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel.\" Mormon\n  Doctrine, p. 391]\n\n  \"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from\n  Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose\n  name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that\n  dwelleth between the cherubims.

(Ps. 83:13,16,18)\n\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah's\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\n5:27)\n\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\nBible reveals that \"Elohim's\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\n\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\n\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\n\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\nman's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\ntruth about who created man.\n\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\n  him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)\n\n  \"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for\n  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have\n  made_....\n  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on \"souls...I\n  have made\" added)\n\n  \"Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...\n  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee\n  from the womb_.\n  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...\n  I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...\n  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD\n  [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.\n  4:32,35)\n\n  \"Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the\n  earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the\n  people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)\n\n  \"...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of\n  Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon\n  the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)\n\n        The Bible reveals that it is \"Jehovah\" who is the \"Elohim of the\nspirits of all flesh\" and \"of all flesh\" itself, that it was He who\n\"formed the spirit of man within him,\" that He \"made us this soul\" and\n\"formed us from the womb.\" He did indeed \"create man.\"\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\"\nthen they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\n\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\n\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I\n  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\n  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\n  all things that in them are.\n  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\n\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\n\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\n\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\n  Abraham's writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: \"We will\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\n\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\n\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\n\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\n\n        Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\n\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\n\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\n\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\n\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\n\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\n\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\n  developed....\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\n  Father, and to him only....\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\n\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\n\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\n\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\n\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\n\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\n\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\n\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\n\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\n\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\n\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\n\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\nidolatry.\n\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)\n\n  \"Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)\n\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)\n\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].\n  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:\n  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto\n  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)\n\n  \"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\n  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)\n\n  \"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;\n  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to\n  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.\n  (Josh. 23:7)\n\n  \"...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)\n\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\n  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)\n\n  \"And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,\n  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods\n  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about\n  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]\n  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)\n\n  \"Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\n\n  \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\n  24:15-16)\n\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\nand all therein.\n\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\n\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim's\" covenant\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim's\" of\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\n\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\n\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\nworld to redeem mankind.\n\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\n\"Jehovah.\"\n\nSummary\n\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\n\n        In answer to Jesus' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\n\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\n\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\n1)\n\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\nThe Bible says:\n\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\n\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\n\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\n\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\n\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life. (John\n17:3)\n\n  \"...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you.\" (Ju. 2:3. See also\n  Exod. 23:32-33)",

If anything, one could claim that,\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\n\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\n\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\nsalvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\nmartyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.\n\nZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from\nMazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The\netymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name,\nas uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else-\nwhere. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the\nGreek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old\nIranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht,\nseveral Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht.\nWe can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra,\nmeans \"camel.\" The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used\ntraditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when\nZarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into\ncommon use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books\nof Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.]\n  Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in\nWestern culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented,\nand heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas (\"songs\"),\nattributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the\nAvesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha\nSpentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha\nVashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the\nprophet's death.\n  Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger\nAvesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the\nPahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid\ninscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is\nmentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who\nseems unaware of him).\n  The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true\nchronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect\nway, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose\nwas not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the\nother hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra,\nalthough from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him\nsix thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus,\nHermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The\naccount by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean\nsix hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes\nagainst Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes\nreference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut\nHumbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it\nis generally rejected.\n  Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are\nnonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history\nof the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as\nthe above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time\nZarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an\nextremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet\ncould not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close\nto, that of the Achaemenids.\n  Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono-\nlogy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord-\ning to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander.\nAgain, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as\nhistorically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical\njustification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the\nlatter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface\nbecause it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed\nby Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around the\nbeginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex\nproblems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the\npart of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this\ncontext, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after\nthe beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and\nVishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium\n(thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).\n  Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to\nreconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally\non the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus\nthe Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the\ngreat political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of\nthe first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that\nperiod, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same\ntime, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be\njustified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara-\nthushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the\nmost legitimate.\n  As to Zarathushtra's land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of\nvalid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that\nhe was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra\nwith Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language\nof the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose,\nboth on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east,\neven though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable\nvariety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view\nthat he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian\nregion, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however,\nZarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the\nHindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia\n(modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would\nthus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.\n  Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna\n33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a\nspecific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned\nreligious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an\nathravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly\ncaste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used\nto lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the\nproduct of a great and original ethical mind.\n  Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India\nto Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan,\nor \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks\ntruth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate -\nand blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the \"vision\nof asha,\" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the\n\"vision of the Sun,\" a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this\nlanguage lies the great tradition of \"Aryan mysticism,\" that is, of Indo-Iranian\nmysticism.\n  Zarathushtra's greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a\nparticular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength\nof his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force-\nfully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic\nmonotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the\nevil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl.,\nFrashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti] \n  Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological\ndoctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra's teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi-\ntions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic\nand ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem\nof evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward\nreligiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi-\ntion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.\n  Another original facet of Zarathushtra's message, one that is not easy to\nunderstand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the\ncomplex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the\nAmesha Spentas, the \"beneficent immortals.\" These are spiritualizations of the\nabstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous\ndevotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a\nsystem of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the\nmanifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.]\n  Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (\"possessing gray horses\"),\nand of his mother, Dughdova (\"one who has milked\"), we know almost nothing of\nZarathushtra's life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.\nAccording to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at\nthirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful\ninspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did\nhe succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was\nstrongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly\ngroups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility\ncaused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of\nKavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with\nhis wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two\nyears old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (\"desiring pastures\"),\nand of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more\nsons, Urvatatnara (\"commanding men\") and Hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of\nhis second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (\"possessing good\ncattle\") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned:\nFrashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi's father, and the latter as the\nhusband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (\"very thoughtful\"),\nwhose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again,\naccording to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was\nassassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the\nTuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi\nform).\n  The paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi-\ntion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian\ncommunities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of\nthe Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as\npassages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth\ncentury, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i\nBahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about\nZarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the\nperfect man.\n  Zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the\nRenaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic\nperiods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an \"alien\nwisdom,\" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer,\npsychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the\ninfluence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always\nopenly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and\nadvocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as\na precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the\nbiblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural\nsign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three\nMagi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is\nderived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the\nFuture. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the\nSasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the\nspread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra's popularity in the\nChristian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised\noften by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three\ngreat messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture\nand heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss-\nance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara-\nthushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was\nviewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean\nOracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a\npossible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in\nVoltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.\n  After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave\nthe name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883-\n1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the\ntrue motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between\ngood and evil. [See also Zoroastrianism]",

Macroevolution is\n>    a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed\n>    within three percent error :) ]\n\nLet us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by\nsentence.\n\n\n1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.\n\nOrigins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\n\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\n\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\non what origins we are talking about.\n\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\n\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\n\nMore to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\nscope of discussion.\n\n4) This is a false premise.\n\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\n\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\n\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\n\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.\n\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\n\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\n\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\nwith the following contextual modification:\n\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\n\n-----\n\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\n-- \nRichard Harter: SMDS Inc.

It seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted to\nalt.conspiracy.\n\nAssuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree'\nmeasurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than the\nmore common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at\nleast 2 misconceptions:\n\n1.  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C.\n    Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are\n    iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun\n    were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel\n    parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be\n    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.\n\n2.  A fire is not an isothermal process.  There are 'hot' spots and\n    'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.   So the\n    weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to\n    imply.  And, even if it was, so what?  It would not have melted\n    anyway.\n\ndarin\nwilkins@scubed.com\n________________________________\n|                              |\n| I will be President for food |\n|______________________________|",

Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow\nhim to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I\nsuspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.\n\nIt is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from\nall perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any\nconclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my\nperspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to\nlife; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what\nthey like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in\nfavour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise\nsolution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and\ndeciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This\nis also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own\ndecisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy\nwith current UK abortion law.\n\nSimilarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and\nI really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't even\nknow enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.\n\n\nmathew",

As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,\nme, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)\nin the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,\nan earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by\nsight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things\nto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of\nGod's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of\nthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed\nthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations (\"I\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . .\" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\n(\"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\nthem to the earth . . .\" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\n\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\nwe made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: \"Where wast thou\nwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" Job 38:4-7).  We\nlost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the \"Veil of Forgetful-\nness,\" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.\n\nYou may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the\nBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular\naspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.\n\n#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so\n#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,\n#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?\n#\n#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\n(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd\nas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe\nin the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They\nwill cry \"heresy\" and other accusations of \"perverting\" the doctrines of\nthe Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as\nfound in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)\n\nAs for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as\nexplained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea\nScroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not\nleast, modern-day revelation on the subject.\n\n#I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.\n#\n#                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that\n#                        he is acting according to God's will, and who there-\n#     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by\n#                        stabbing you in the back?\n#\n#                                                        -Voltaire\n\n\nCasper C.

        "content": "Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use\nthe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \ncommon.\n\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\n\nFor example,\n\nStory of Adam and Eve:\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\n\nTraditional Philosophy:\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This\nis why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \nquestion by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.\n\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\n\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \nthemselves.\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\n\n1990's philosophy:\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\n\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\n\nLessons from new interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\nis ideal.\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\nlife for their children (and themselves).\n\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\nEve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \nuntil it was actively sought.\n\n---End serious discussion.  Begin humor.--\n\nSave this post to disk (or file server).  Someday it will be considered the\nmost important writing since the 10 Commandments.  You want an original copy.\n\nStay tuned for the RFD on soc.religion.eveism...\nCan I get a tax deduction for money I donate to this organization?\n\n--Return to serious discussion when posting follow-ups.--\n\nStephen Weinstein\nweinss@rpi.edu",

I have clearly\nshown one of your shortcomings, if not two.  That is, ignorance of the Bible\nand the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its \ncontents.\n\n> I regard Christ as a myth. \n\nBecause you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.\nAnd to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not\neven know what the word \"Christ\" means.  Or which prophet used \"Christ\" to \ndescribe the \"Son of Man\". \n\n> I feel that there are far too many people\n> offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and\n> did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.\n\nYes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Come\nup with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being said\nand by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else's\ninterpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you the\ntruth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as \nmuch as a coffee cup needs interpretation.\n\nAnd remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.  \nIt doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The \nBible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed \nto people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it \ntheir open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because they\nwant you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to\nknow.   They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple\nstraight-forward language.\n\n> I choose the\n> roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of\n> any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn\n> back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.\n\nYou have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen the\nroad that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that\nroad doesn't look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  One\nthat goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this,\nyou will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly. \n\n>And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your\n>eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I'm not just spouting off\n>empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.\n\nI see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading your\nlife.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing \nnew in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are \"spouting off\" \ncontradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must\nbe sad.\n\n> I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to\n> definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to\n> you so you can ask her, face-to-face.\n> You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask? \n\nBingo.  For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son\nso that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I look\nwhat God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have \nhope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has\nglorious purpose.\n\n> You can't even convince me that it exists! \n\nBecause you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose to\nlie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for \nthousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of \nJesus's story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a \nbleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:\n\n      \"For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets,\n       he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead.\"\n\n> If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold\n> pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my\n> rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can\n> *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful\n> it is.\n\nArrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specific\ncases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect\nin heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus does\nnot expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not\nas his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his\nglorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.  \nYou maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself for\nyourself.\n\n>>Why would you want to live a good life?\n>>To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have\n>>no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the\n>>end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because\n>>everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading\n>>a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?\n\n>That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word\n>I've said.\n\nI do understand what you said.   But that's is not what I feel went amiss here.\n\nYou missed the point.  Living a \"good life\" has no eternal consequences.\nOnce they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it \nis over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. \nIt has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. \n\nBut then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things \nis bad.  To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is\nall meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone\nyou dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What's restraining you?\nLife after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.\n\n> In the same way, I think life is fun.  And I don't intend to leave the\n> amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D\n\nAt which time, you are truly not the master of yourself.\n\n>>I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god\n>>I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in\n>>which case it's not really all that important.\n>\n>Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.\n\nSo you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa\nClaus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to\nbelieve that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I\ncan't similarly apply to Santa Claus.\n\nYou have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses\nof Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and \"ignore\" the\nreasons.  By definition, \"ignorance\". \n\nSanta Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves\nand flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in human\nhistory seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose \nblinks red?    \n\nOn the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar really\na king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomon\nreally kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin?\nDid Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  Did\nSennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a \nCaiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies\nit.  It is NONFICTION.\n\nDo you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps you\ncan't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from\nthat of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equal\ntruthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Or\nis it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out\nthat it's not a fairy tale?\n\n>Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a\n>collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without\n>invoking them?\n\nGet real.  Have you ever been to Zaire?  Do you have to go there\nto be  assured that there really is such a place?  Given your \nirrationality, I take it you have never used a map in your life.\n\n> Why do you believe what you believe?\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living\nGod, I'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if I didn't follow Jesus.",

        "content": ": In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\n: reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. \n\nI'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is\ninterpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on\nthe values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\nactivity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or\nethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure\nfrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.\n\nBill\n\n: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\n: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\n: the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\n\n: So, back to the original question:\n\n: And objective morality is.....?\n\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\nobjective sense.\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\ninfinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself\ndoesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as\n\nBill\nmuch to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it\nor not, it's there.x",

They\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before \"the night of the\nlong knives\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\nescapes me at the moment) called \"Homosexuals in History\" asserts that Roehm\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.\n\n>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,\n>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and\n>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. \n\nWell, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \"knight of the\nlong knives\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've \nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \n\n>(Irving, a\n>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance\n>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)\n\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they \nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \n\n>I challenge anyone to document this claim.\n\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\n\n>I *have* found a great\n>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the\n>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,\n>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.\n\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\n\nI don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.\n\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\n\nNo, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\n                                                                           \n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\nDavid Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)\n\"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softly\nof us in days hereafter...\" (Ezra Pound)\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/",

This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \n\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\nII.\n\n\tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\n\ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\n\tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\n\tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\n\tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\n\tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\n\tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\n\tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\n\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses \"divine word,\" but also that\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \nbattle.)\n\n\tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\n\tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\n\twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\n\tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\n\n\tNo officer was with me, no charioteer,\n\tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\n\tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\n\tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them.\n\tHis majesty spoke: \"What is this, father Amun?\n\tIs it right for a father to ignore his son?\n\tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\n\tDo I not walk and stand at your word?\n\tI have not neglected an order you gave.\n\tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\n\tTo allow aliens to step on his path!\n\tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\n\tThe wretches ignorant of god?\n\tHave I not made for you many great monuments,\n\t...\n\tI call to you, my father Amun,\n\tI am among a host of strangers;\n\tAll countries are arrayed against me,\n\tI am alone, there's none with me!\n\t...\n\tThe labors of many people are nothing,\n\tAmun is more helpful than they;\n\tI came here by the command of your mouth,\n\tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!\"\n\n\tNow though I prayed in a distant land,\n\tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\n\tI found Amun came when I called to him,\n\tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\n\tHe called from behind as if near by:\n\t\"Forward, I am with you,\n\tI your father, my hand is with you,\n\tI prevail over a hundred thousand men,\n\tI am lord of victory, lover of valor!\"\n\tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\n\tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\n\t...\n\tI slaughtered among them at my will,\n\tNot one looked behind him,\n\tNot one turned around,\n\tWhoever fell down did not rise.\n\t...\n\tOne called out to the other saying:\n\t\"No man is he who is among us,\n\tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\n\tNot deeds of man are these his doings,\n\tThey are of one who is unique,\n\tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\n\tCome quick, flee before him,\n\tTo seek life and breathe air;\n\tFor he who attempts to get close to him,\n\tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp.\n\tOne cannot hold either bow or spears,\n\tWhen one sees him come racing along!\"\n\tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin,\n\tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.\n\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being\n*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\nwords: \n\n    \"question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?\"\n\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\n\"all or nothing\" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\ncompletely credible. \n\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\nmust be true:\n\n> Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \n> Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\n> shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\n> programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\n> complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\n> that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\n> display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\n> King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln?\n \nI have three points.  \n\nFirst, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\nthe testimony of Hindus:\n\n\t\"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \n\t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \n\t hooey?\"\n\nIf you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special\npleading?\n\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \n\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was\nmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a\ndeist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've\npreviously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc. \n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    \"My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of \n     salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become \n     clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for \n     thinking I shall ever change them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tAbraham Lincoln\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Judge J S Wakefield \n\t\t\t\t\tafter the death of Willie Lincoln.",

But they have been systematically \n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \n\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \n          space and time: \n    \n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \n    \n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \n    \n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \n          DATUM\"). \n      \n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \n          BURSTS). \n          \n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \n          matter. \n\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \n          complex mathematics, in his books. \n    \n\n\n          BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson\n          \n               The following is a complete list of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  Some of the early \n          books are out of print now, but still available through \n          inter-library loan. \n    \n               \"The Structure of the Physical Universe\" (1959) \n    \n               \"The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom\" (1963)\n    \n               \"Beyond Newton\" (1964) \n    \n               \"New Light on Space and Time\" (1965) \n    \n               \"Quasars and Pulsars\" (1971) \n    \n               \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979) \n                    [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION \"Super \n                                                            Collider\".] \n                    [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]\n\n               \"The Neglected Facts of Science\" (1982) \n     \n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" (1984)\n                    [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical\n                                                            mysteries.] \n      \n               \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988)\n\n               All but the last of these books were published by North \n          Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and \n          should be available via inter-library loan if your local \n          university or public library doesn't have each of them. \n\n               Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available \n          from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS), \n          1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, \"THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help \"prove\" Einstein's \"General Theory of Relativity\". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \n          holes\", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to \"prove\" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \"NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \n    \n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. \n    \n               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many \n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \n    \n               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles \n          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses \n          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and \n          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a \n          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. \n    \n          \n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED. \n\n\n                                       Robert E.

I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by\nI think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that\nBenjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings\non Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how\nmuch he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and \nAristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus\nmakes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology,\nthe id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus\nexplained it far better and gave reasons.\n\nThomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They\ncan screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these\nmen on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly,\nhe thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.\n\nHere's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians\nthat \"that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is \nspiritually discerned.\"  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a\nclue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that's\nincredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally\nbizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance on\nmy part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless,\nit is a truth, explainable or not.\n\nAre any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those\ndot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in front\nof you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If\nyour eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals\nembedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand\nout from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green,\nyou will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot\ntest appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.\n\nA normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a\ntotal anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something.\nIt is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything\nthat to him is as plain as day.\n\nThat it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer.\nThe believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns\nfit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the\nother hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinks\nI am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and\nsay, \"No, you are weird.  You do not see.\"   Then it is time for a sanity\ncheck.  I go to another Christian and say, \"Do you see this.\"  And\nthey go, \"Yes.  It is an \"X\"\".  And I say, \"Thank God, I see the \"X\"\ntoo.\"\n\nIt is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to\nthe phrase, \n\n         \"He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.\"\n\n\nI am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see.

I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\nseems to argue over what.\n\n>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the \"who and \n>why\" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or \n>agnostics.\n\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \nthink the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \nincapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \n\n>Do you suggest that the \"who and why\" will forever be closed to scientific \n>investigation?\n\nNo.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \nIsn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \nconvoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  \n\n>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on\n>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.\n\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \nnaturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\n\n>|>Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota\n\n>Did like your discussion around AMHs, and I did figure out what AMH was from\n>your original post :-)\n\nMuch obliged.

        "subject": "Hell",
        "content": "In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words \ntranslated into the word \"hell\".  These Greek words have totally different \nmeanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.\n\n    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the \nNew Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol...\nmeaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be \nlikened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)\n\n    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell\nto translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  \n\n    Why?  Because when seeing the word \"hell\" many readers impute to it the \ntraditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never \nremotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!\n\n    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of \nthe dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of \n\"shadowy realm.\"  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to \nthis hell.\n\n    The second \"hell\" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in \nscripture, 2 Pet.2:4; \"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \nthem down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be \nreserved unto judgment...\"\n\n    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; \nRev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels \n(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to \nTartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the \nmutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).\n\n    Tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or\ndemons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe \nthe place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible \nis there any mention of men being put into this particular \"hell\".\n\n    The the third word that is translated as \"hell\" in the Bible is Gehenna. It\ncomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning \"valley of Hinniom.\"  Hinnom is a \ndeep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.\n\n    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including \ninfant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made \ntheir children \"pass through the fire\" to the god Molech.  The rites were \nspecifically celebrated in Tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief \ngroves in the valley).\n\n    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He \ndefiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later \nthe valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for \nsewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were \nalso burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding \nby a constant supply of garbage and refuse.\n\n    Aceldama, the \"field of blood\", purchased with the money Judas received for\nthe betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.\n\n    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?  \n\n    In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working \nreligious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the \nre-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.\nTheir fate is revealed by the apostle John: \"And the beast was taken, and with \nhim the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire \nburning with brimstone.\"\n    \n    Where will this temporary lake of fire (this \"hell\") be?\n\n    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: \"For \nTophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is \nprepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, \nthe breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it\" (Isa.30:33).\n\n    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled \nfiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).\n\n    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible \nsay that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of \nfire?\n\n    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be \nthrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will \nbecome of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity? \n \n    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna \nfire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This \npunishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the \n\"second death\" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a \nfurther resurrection.\n\n    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.\n                           \n    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. \"For, behold, the day \ncometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do \nwickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up...\"\n(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be \"ashes under the \nsoles of your feet...\"(Mal.4:3).\n\n    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living \ntorture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or \nvalley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, \nbut ashes!\n \n    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means \ncomplete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The \nBible says, in Romans 6:23, \"The wages of sin is death\", not eternal life in \ntorture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of \nlife. \n    \n    Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD!",

It's similar to collecting coins,\nor stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model\ntrains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about\neverything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it something\nof an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really;\nit's just a hobby.  The collector yearns for diversity (not much use in\nhaving TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical\nsignificance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance\n(this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first\none to do it this way), rarity, and so on.\n\nSome people use their collections, other people do not.  As you state, you\nuse your collection.  In one sense, this diminishes the value of your\ncollection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  In another sense, it\ncan enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  Some people collect\nfirearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms\nthey collect.  It's just personal preference.\n\nOops, 'personal preference' ... I guess we're not supposed to have that any\nmore, are we?\n\nJ.Baker.",
